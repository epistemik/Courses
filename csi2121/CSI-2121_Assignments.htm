<H2>Directives for CSI 2121 and CSI 2521 assignments</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>There will be 1 assignment at each 2 or 3 weeks interval. Each assignment 
  will be posted at the end of this page. </P>
  <P>The assignments consist of programming exercises only. You will also find, 
  in the lecture notes, some theoretical exercises which will not be marked. 
  These theoretical exercises are not part of any assignment; they are provided 
  to improve your knowledge of the material and give you some typical examples 
  of questions that might be asked at the final exam. The solutions to these 
  theoretical exercises can normally be found by writing a small ASM program 
  that you will trace with a debugger. </P>
  <P><B>You must hand your assignments electronically by email to the specified 
  TA</B> who will mark your assignment and return to you by email your annotated 
  assignment and your mark. Hence you will be able to send your assignments 
  directly from the comfort of your home but, conversely, <B>we will not accept 
  assignments in hard-copy form.</B> </P>
  <P>Normally, you will be given 10 days to do your assignments. Since the 
  Internet is reliable, the specified deadline to return your assignment is HARD 
  (and final). <FONT color=#ff0000><B>No late copy will be 
  accepted!!!</B></FONT> </P>
  <P>Assignments must be done individually. <FONT color=#000000><B>If this is 
  not the case, your mark will be divided by the number of teammates!</B></FONT> 
  </P>
  <P>The specified TA to whom you will sent your assignment will vary from one 
  assignment to the other: it will be specified on the assignment. 
<BR>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>To submit your assignment you must follow precisely all these 
directives:</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Each assignment consist of (one or more) programming exercises. Normally 
  you should provide one .ASM source file per programming exercise. Each source 
  file must be named&nbsp; according to the assignment number and the 
  programming exercise of that assignment. For example, the source file of 
  programming exercise 2 of assignment 3 must be named <B>ass3-2.asm</B> (in 
  lower case). <B>You must provide only the source .ASM files. We will not 
  accept executable .EXE files</B>. The TA will personally generate the 
  executable from each source and then run that executable only. (We think that, 
  in previous years, some students cheated by sending an executable which did 
  not come from their source file. This is one of the reasons why we do not 
  accept executables anymore.) </P>
  <P>Of course, since we use bcc32 (Borland's C++ compiler front end) to 
  assemble and link. All your source file must assemble (and link) correctly 
  with the bcc32 version that we have in our labs. It is that version that the 
  TA will use to produce executables from your sources. If you have at home C++ 
  builder 3 or later (under Windows 95/98/NT), this should work fine. If you use 
  Microsoft Visual C++ with MASM, please test that the bcc32 in our labs handles 
  your files correctly. Do not use any other assembler such as NASM or GAS. </P>
  <P>By using the <A href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</A> utility, you must 
  archive together all the .ASM source file of the same assignment into a 
  <B>single</B> .ZIP file and then attached this .ZIP file with an email message 
  that you will send to the specified TA. You must name the .ZIP file according 
  to the assignment number and your student number. For example, student number 
  1673458 must name the .ZIP file of assignment 3 as: <B>ass3u1673458.zip</B> 
  (in lower case). </P>
  <P>This .ZIP file must be attached to an email message that must be sent to 
  the specified TA. The subject of your email message must match the assignment 
  number. For example, for assignment 3, the subject line must be <B>handing 
  assignment 3 of CSI 2121/2521</B>. The body of your message must start with 
  the following 2 lines: <BR>&nbsp; </P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <P>Student Name: your name <BR>Student Number: your student 
  number</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P><BR>After that, you can include in the message body an important comment to 
  the TA. But please, include a comment only if it is necessary! </P>
  <P>The TA who will mark you assignment will send you back an email message 
  with a .ZIP file attached containing your sources annotated by the marker. The 
  message body will contain your overall mark for that assignment. The 
  explanations will be included as annotations directly into your source files 
  at the appropriate locations. </P>
  <P><B>It is your responsibility to use an email client that handles email 
  attachments correctly. </B>Both Netscape Messenger (part of Netscape 
  Communicator) and Microsoft Outlook Express handle email attachments cleanly. 
  Hence I suggest that you use either one of these email clients. If you use 
  another email client, please check that it handles attachments correctly by 
  sending to one of your friend (that uses either Netscape Messenger or Outlook 
  Express) an email with one .ZIP file attached. <BR>&nbsp;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Appeal for an unsatisfactory mark</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Marking is made by TAs which can make mistakes. Hence if you think there 
  was an error made by the TA who marked your assignment please send your 
  request to the TA (not to me!) by email with the subject line: <B>Request to 
  review mark of assignment x of CSI 2121/2521</B>. In the body of the message, 
  explain why you think that there was an error made in the marking. Attached 
  with this message, send the exact .ZIP file that the marker returned to you by 
  email attachment with your mark. (Then the marker will compare the .ZIP file 
  you send with the one it has sent to you.) </P>
  <P>Please note that marking is done uniformly over every copy by using the 
  same marking scheme. Hence you cannot appeal for a bad mark because you do not 
  agree with the marking scheme that was used. You can only appeal if you think 
  that there was a mistake. The TA will change your mark only if a mistake was 
  done. So this will occur rarely...</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

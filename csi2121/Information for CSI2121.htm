<H2>Information for CSI2121/2521 Labs</H2>All of our programs will be Win32 
console applications. These are 32-bit protected-mode programs that run in a 
MS-DOS box (but they are not MS-DOS programs). 
<P>To perform simple I/O operations, you should use the set of macros that are 
in the <A 
href="http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~marchand/teaching/CSI2121/csi2121.inc">csi2121.inc</A> 
file. Just place the directive "include csi2121.inc" immediately after the 
".model flat" directive in your source file. The course notes explains how to 
use these macros. 
<P>In the labs, we will assemble our programs with Borland's TASM32 assembler. 
To assemble and link in a single command, it is convenient to use the C compiler 
front-end. Assuming that your assembly language source file is <A 
href="http://www.csi.uottawa.ca/~marchand/teaching/CSI2121/hello.asm">hello.asm</A>, 
to assemble, link, and produce an executable file "hello.exe", just use the 
BCC32 command from the Win32 console (i.e.: the MS-DOS box) prompt: <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR>
<CENTER>
<P>bcc32 -v hello.asm</CENTER><BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR>
<P>Note that bcc32.exe is the 32-bit C/C++ compiler of Borland C++ and Borland 
C++ Builder. But since our source file has the ".asm" extension, this command 
will call TASM32 to assemble your program (in case sensitive mode) and then call 
Borland's incremental linker (called ILINK) to link your program together with 
the C standard library (and other libraries that will give you access to the 
Win32 API) and finally produce the executable file "hello.exe". 
<P>The -v option is to generate full debugging information. To display the list 
of all available options just type "bcc32" without any arguments. To store this 
information into a file named "bcc32-options.txt", just redirect the output to 
this file; i.e.: just type: <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR>
<CENTER>
<P>bcc32 &gt; bcc32-options.txt</CENTER><BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR>
<P>Do not forget to put your source file into the same directory as your 
"csi2121.inc" file. 
<P>To execute your "hello.exe" program you can either type "hello" from the 
Win32 console or double-click on the "hello.exe" icon. However, double-clicking 
on the icon will first create a MS-DOS box, then it will run hello.exe into this 
box and then it will close the MS-DOS box when the program has finished running. 
Hence to prevent your program of running until completion just insert the 
"prompt" macro just before the "done" macro in your source file. The prompt 
macro will just prompt the user to type a key to continue execution. 
<P>Of course you will need an editor to produce your source files. You can use 
Notepad but it is very limited. In the lab, you can use the editor of Borland 
C++ 5.0 (very good). I personally use <A 
href="http://www.lancs.ac.uk/staff/cpaap/pfe/">PFE</A>. It is available in the 
labs and it is free. But I have just seen that the PFE Web page is now closed. 
Apparently the <A href="http://www.idmcomp.com/">UltraEdit32</A> editor is 
pretty good (I have not tried it). 
<P>Finally we will need a debugger. I recommend that you use Borland's Turbo 
Debugger TD32. This debugger runs in a MS-DOS box (so it looks rather clumsy) 
but it has all the functionality that we need (and you can use your mouse). It 
is installed in the labs. To debug "hello.exe", just type: <BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR>
<CENTER>
<P>td32 hello</CENTER><BR>&nbsp; 
<P><BR>
<P>A number of convenient windows are available from the "View" menu, namely: 
<UL>
  <LI>The "Registers" window to view the content of registers 
  <LI>The "Numeric Processor" window to view the content of the FPU registers 
  <LI>The "CPU" window to view both your source code and the machine language 
  equivalent 
  <LI>The "Watches" window to view the content of variables and memory </LI></UL>A 
number of convenient commands are available from the "Run" menu, namely: 
<UL>
  <LI>The "Trace into" (F7) command to single step into your program 
  <LI>The "Step over" (F8) command to single step into your program but avoid 
  entering into procedures 
  <LI>The "Instruction trace" (Alt-F7) command to trace to the next instruction 
  and force the entrance into procedures 
  <LI>The "Run" command to run your program up to the position of the next 
  breakpoint (you define a breakpoint just by clicking on the point to the left 
  of the instruction where you want your program to stop). If you have not 
  defined any breakpoints, this will run your program to completion. </LI></UL>

<H3>Additional Notes</H3>BCC32, TASM32, and ILINK are part of the distribution 
of C++ Builder 3 or higher and Borland C++ 5.0 or higher. Hence you will be able 
to assemble and link programs with BCC32 if you have one of these products. But 
you will not be able to debug with TD32 because it is part of the distribution 
of Turbo Debugger (not free). You can use the IDE of Borland C++ Builder 3 or 
higher to assemble, link, and debug assembly language programs. However, C++ 
Builder 3 has no CPU debug window so you will not be able to view registers (not 
very useful). But C++ Builder 4 has a CPU window that will show registers but 
not the FPU registers (so it will not be helpful when you will try to debug 
programs that use the FPU). I do not know anything about the IDE of Borland C++ 
5.0. If you want to buy a product, I suggest that you buy C++ Builder 4. 
<H3>Using C++ Builder 4 to assemble, link, and debug</H3>To use the IDE of C++ 
Builder 4 to assemble, link and debug assembly language programs, you can do the 
following: 
<P>First place both your source file, say "hello.asm", and your "csi2121.inc" 
file in the same (safe) directory (i.e.: inside your user directory). After 
launching C++ Builder 4, choose "New..." from the "File" menu. Choose the 
"Console Wizard" and make sure that you have selected "Console" and "EXE" from 
the options offered by the Wizard and then click "Finish". Now, choose "Save 
Project As..." from the "File" menu and save it under a name, say 
"ProjectHello.bpr", in the same place as your source file (here "hello.asm"). 
Then choose "Add to Project..." from the "Project" menu and select your assembly 
source "hello.asm". The IDE constantly reads and writes into two files, here 
they should be named "ProjectHello.cpp" (a c++ source file) and 
"ProjectHello.bpr" (your makefile). You absolutely need these two file: do not 
delete them. To view your source file under this IDE just use "Open..." from the 
file menu. Next, edit your "ProjectHello.cpp" file so that it contains *only* 
the following lines (yes, we do get rid of the "main" function): 
<P>#include &lt;condefs.h&gt; <BR>//------------------------------- 
<BR>USEASM("hello.asm"); <BR>//------------------------------- <BR>#define main 
<P>Then save again your project with the "Save" command. Next, choose "Build 
ProjectHello" under the "Project" menu to assemble and link your program. Then 
choose "Run" to run your program. Your program's output will appear on the Win32 
console but the console will immediately disappear. To avoid this disappearance, 
use the prompt macro just before the RET instruction in your source file. Then 
the console will disappear only after you type a key. To debug your program just 
choose the "Trace Into" command from the "Run" menu and the CPU window should 
appear. The debugger is very similar to TD32. Other debugging windows are 
available from the "Debug Window" command under the "View" menu. Note the 
absence of a "Numeric Processor" window. <BR>

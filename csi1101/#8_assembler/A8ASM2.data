/file: a8asm2.dat////This file contains a program that computes the quotient//and remainder of X divided by Y, using the algorithm described in// a8asm1.dat but the program here stores the variables// BEFORE the body of the program, not after it.//This is done by having a JMP instruction at the very beginning//which jumps over the variables to the first instruction in the program.//In the following, the program actually begins at location 0012.//Nine locations are reserved for variables, although at present//some of the locations are unused.////ONE is not a variable, but a constant: its value is initialized//to 1 and never changed.  This is makes it easy to subtract 1, as required//in the program (statement [7])./////     JMP  [1]X    BYTE 25Y    BYTE 07Quot BYTE 00Rem  BYTE 00A    BYTE 00ONE  BYTE 01U009 BYTE 00U010 BYTE 00U011 BYTE 00[1]  CLA     STA Quot[2]  LDA X     STA A[3]  LDA Quot     INC     STA Quot     LDA A[4]  SUB Y     STA A[5]  JN  [6]     JMP [3][6]  ADD Y     STA Rem[7]  LDA Quot     SUB ONE     STA Quot[8]  DSP Quot[9]  DSP Rem     HLT

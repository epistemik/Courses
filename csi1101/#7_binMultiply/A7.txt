CSI 1101                    ASSIGNMENT #7due date:  10:40 p.m., Wednesday, March 17, 1999issue date: Monday, March 8, 1999.You must do this assignment INDIVIDUALLY and follow all thegeneral instructions and programming standards for the coursesee the course home page for these).Marking Scheme:-------------- 15 marks -- programming standards (including memory leaks) 61 marks -- question 1 12 marks -- question 2(a) 12 marks -- question 2(b)---------100 marks totalProgram and DATA Handout------------------------The file A7.DAT  (available on course home page)  contains the data withwhich to test your program.  Make your own local copy of this file.The starting point for this assignment is the solution to assignment #6,question #2.  You may use your own solution to assignment #6, question 2,or the model solution, which will be posted Saturday March 13 in theafternoon.You may write any additional procedures you wish, but do not change the onesyou are given except to make the specific changes required for question 2.If there are changes that you would like to make send me email(holte@site.uottawa.ca) or come to my office to discuss them.Hint: Do not wait until March 13 to start working on this.      You can design your solution completely before getting the      model solution, and you can code it and begin to test it with your      own solution for assignment #6 even if it is not entirely bug-free.Question 1.-----------Write the  procedure MULTIPLY that is given two unsigned binary numbers(represented as in assignment 6), N1 and N2, and returns a new number(represented in the same manner) representing the PRODUCT of N1 and N2.Question 2.-----------In this question you may change any parts of the given program - includingthe type definitions, the main program, etc. - but the changes you makemust be minimal.(a) Change the program so that the input data is read from a file whose    Windows/DOS name is A7.DAT .  Each line of this file will contain    one binary number in the same form that the user entered them in    assignment #6 (i.e. each line of the file will contain one unsigned    binary number and nothing else, etc.).    Change the program so it does not prompt the user for input.    Also change it so that it does not ask the user if he/she wishes to    continue but, instead, it should continue until it reaches    the end of the input file (this can be tested using the eof function).    You do not have to do any error checking on the input - you may assume    each line contains nothing but 0's and 1's (or is empty - an empty input    line represents the number 0) and that there are an even number of input    lines in the data file.(b) The given program writes its output to the screen.    Change the program so that it writes all its output to the    file A7OUT.TXT

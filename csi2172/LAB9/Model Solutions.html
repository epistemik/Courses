<H1>Laboratory 9: 1999 Winter Project</H1>This project was given in the Winter 
semester of 1999 and it involves quite a few design patterns and it also touches 
on some advanced techniques. The outline of the model was provided for the 
students but the bonus questions go far beyond elementary object oriented 
modeling. Understanding how the pieces are put together and how the model 
provides flexibility and maintainability is important. This project involved 
virtually all basic steps and techniques of basic object oriented design.

  <UL>The trick is to observe that the evaluation tree can be wrong in two 
    ways: <PRE>        
          *               *
         / \             / \
        2   +           +   4
           / \         / \
          3   4       2   3

        (WRONG)       (WRONG)
         
           |             |
           |             |
           V             V
    
           +            +
          / \          / \
         *   4        2   *
        / \              / \
       2   3            3   4
      
        (GOOD)         (GOOD)

       </PRE>So we declare a new class called 
    <TT>binary_operator_adaptor</TT> which holds one binary operator expression. 
    In its constructor, if the binary expression's left-hand-side or 
    right-hand-side has lower precedence than itself, then we swing the tree 
    (recursivelly) so it looks good. <BR><BR>Although I did not ask, an 
    expression like <TT>(3+5)/(1+3)</TT> should not really be stored as a tree 
    but as <TT>2</TT>. In other words expressions can be simplified (<I>check 
    out the <TT>simplify</TT> method</I>). The only place where we cannot 
    simplify if there is a variable inside the expression (<I>ie, if you really 
    went all the way...</I>). But even then, it can be <I>partially</I> 
    simplified: <TT>(2+6)*x</TT> = <TT>8*x</TT>, or <TT>(x-1)/(3+4)</TT> = 
    <TT>(x-1)/7</TT>. <BR><BR>The <TT>evaluate</TT> signature also has to 
    change, because an expression may contain variables, hanve a 
    <TT>double*</TT> argument represents an array of bindings in the current 
    context. </UL>

    </CENTER>The strategy is to find one point on the perimeter of the figure 
    which is inside. Once we have that point <TT>p</TT> then we can recursivelly 
    halve the distance between <TT>p</TT> and <TT>o</TT> (<I>towards 
    <TT>p</TT></I>) until it is inside the figure. To find <TT>p</TT>, we can 
    use one of the corners, or if there is no corner inside we can find two 
    intersecting points and use their median. Check out <TT>shape::inside</TT>, 
    <TT>shape::intersects</TT> and <TT>shape::find_in</TT>. It is the same for 
    the ellipse, after all, it is drawn with lines between points. There is 
    another case, maybe the figure totally surrounds the canvas and the middle 
    is still not in. In that case, you should check that at least one of the 
    points have to have a mapped <TT>x</TT> coordinate which is less than 0, one 
    which is larger than <TT>width</TT>, one mapped <TT>y</TT> coordinate less 
    tan 0 and one larger than <TT>height</TT> <BR><BR>All of the above is 
    <B>only</B> true for <I>convex</I> shapes, but that is all what we have. 
    <BR><BR>These files test if your bonus implementation is OK: <PRE>         <A href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/ftppub/courses/Fall/csi2172A/labs/lab9/e1.pic">e1.pic</A> // ellipse test
         <A href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/ftppub/courses/Fall/csi2172A/labs/lab9/t1.pic">t1.pic</A> // triangle test
         <A href="http://www.site.uottawa.ca/ftppub/courses/Fall/csi2172A/labs/lab9/r1.pic">r1.pic</A> // rectangle test
      </PRE>If your (bonus) implementation does not work, you will only see 
    lines. </UL>
  <LI>
  <H3>Parameter Passing, Recursion, ....</H3>You would have to build a new 
  hierarchy (<I>check out <TT>statement</TT> </I>), which would store the actual 
  statements of the user defined figure, puts them into a 
  <TT>figure_descriptor</TT> and registers it in a <TT>symbol_table</TT>....

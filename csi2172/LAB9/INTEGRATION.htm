<H1>Integration</H1>Suppose you and your partner have finished and debugged your 
code for stream A and B (<I>the independent bonuses -- precedence of expressions 
and filling clipped figures -- are irrelevant</I>). Here comes the big bonus. 
Wherever in the figure scripts you used a numeric constant for project B, you 
can replace it with a constant expression. Examples: <PRE>  define canvas(30,30); 
  <FONT color=red>define canvas(20+5+5,2*15);</FONT>
  set pen_color [200,0,50]; 
  <FONT color=red>set pen_color [300-100,5-5,(2+3)*(6+4)]</FONT>
  ...
</PRE>
<H1>HINT</H1>Wherever you had a <TT>lex.read_numeric(is)</TT> in the parser, you 
should have something like <TT>expr_parser.read(is)-&gt;evaluate()</TT>. 
<BR><BR>Unless you have some debugging to do, this should do the trick and earns 
you a 3 marks reward! 
<H1>HOW DO WE HAND IT IN?</H1>
<UL>
  <LI>create a subdirectory on the diskette, called <TT>integ</TT>. you will 
  have all <B>your</B> code under this subdirectory that should make this 
  program work including code for streams A and B. 
  <LI>printout of <B>only</B> those files that needed changes, and use a 
  highlighter to show what had to be changed for the integration to work

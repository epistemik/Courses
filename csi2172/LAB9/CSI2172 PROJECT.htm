<H1>PROJECT</H1>Before you start actually writing any code, 
<UL>
  <LI>read very carefully this announcement 
  <LI>set a <I>realistic</I> goal for yourself 
  <LI>if you decide to go for part of the bonus, make sure your partner has the 
  same intentions 
  <LI>for most part, <B>you have to work individually</B> and for that you will 
  be graded separately. in fact, it is possible to achieve 100% (<I> or 
  more</I>) without having a partner 
  <LI>I would prefer if you work with a partner and I expect partners to help 
  each other!, but you will not receive any marks for your contribution in your 
  partner's work! 
  <LI>when you find a partner, <B>one</B> of you have to do <B>PROJECT A</B> and 
  the other <B>PROJECT B</B>, if you can integrate your work, the bonus will 
  apply to the two parts equally 
  <LI>if you do not understand the rules, make sure you clarify them with me, no 
  later excuses 
  <LI>if you decided on a partner, and you are sure, register your group with 
  the TA. he will mark all the projects, and will show up in the Friday labs to 
  answer questions. 
  <LI>after March 12, <B>absolutely no</B> project group modifications. That is, 
  you may not change partners, regardless what the circumstances are. if your 
  partner has dropped the course, you can still achieve a 100. 
  <LI><B>DO NOT HAND IN A PRINTOUT OF MY CODE!</B> I wrote most of the code that 
  is needed for the project. You <B>only</B> hand in a printout of <B>your</B> 
  work, not the implementation I gave you!!! 
  <LI><B>cheating</B> will be penalized. you may only submit your own work. it 
  will be very obvious for the marker if you have copied or stolen someone's 
  work. if you cheat on this project and yoo were one of those who were caught 
  on the assignments for cheating (<I>whether you actually got 0 or not</I>) you 
  will receive an <B>F</B> for the entire course. Discussions and help amongst 
  partners and groups is encouraged, however taking someone's code and handing 
  it in as your own (<I>regardless whether you changed variable names, 
  indentation and comments</I>) is considered cheating and can be easily 
  discovered and proven. Partners <B>in the same group</B> can "code" together, 
  but you should understand that your contribution in your partner's work is not 
  going to be credited to you. 
  <LI><B>do not panic</B>, if you are not confident, follow my instructions and 
  hints <I>to the letter</I> and start early to make steady progress. </LI></UL>

and red bars represent the difficulty of implementing the particular module 
(<FONT color=blue>blue</FONT> assumes individual and <FONT color=red>red</FONT> 
assumes two people effort). The yellow bars behind them show the actual mark 
value they are worth. This, of course, is a fictional measure, based on my own 
experience when I coded the model solution.

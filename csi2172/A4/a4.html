<H1>Virtual Constructors [ 100 marks ]</H1>

   It is a well known problem in Object Oriented Programming
   that constructors cannot be made <tt>virtual</tt>. Throughout this
   course we used polymorhism and inheritance to achieve 
   maintainability and ease of integration of new features and
   extensions.

   <br><br>
   Unfortunately this does not apply to constructors. Consider
   the class diagram below:

   <CENTER>
      <A HREF="shapes.gif"><IMG SRC="shapes.gif" BORDER=0 WIDTH=60%></A>
   </CENTER>

   <br><br>
   <tt>shape</tt> is an abstract class. Suppose I would like to read instances
   of shapes from the console: 
   <PRE>
      shape** array = new shape*[10];

      for(int i=0; i<10; ++i) {
         array[i]->read(cin); 
      }
   </PRE>
   To be able to invoke the polymorphic method <tt>read</tt>, <tt>array[i]</tt>
   must be allocated! But how can it be allocated when you cannot possible
   know which subclass of <i>shape</i> the object to be read from the console
   belongs to. In philosophy this situation is referred to as 
   a <it>paradox</i>. To be able to invoke a constructor to create
   the instance I have to know its <i>exact</i> type but to be able to
   call a method I need the instance. While <tt>operator&lt;&lt;</tt>
   can be implemented as
   <PRE>

   ostream& <b>operator&lt;&lt;</b>(ostream& <i>os</i>, const shape& <i>s</i>) {
      s.print(<i>os</i>);   // <FONT COLOR=darkgreen>print is polymorphic</FONT>
      return <i>os</i>;
   }

   </PRE>
   <tt>operator&gt;&gt;</tt> <b><FONT COLOR=red>cannot</FONT></b>
    be implemented as

   <PRE>

   istream& <b>operator&gt;&gt;</b>(istream& <i>is</i>, shape& <i>s</i>) {
      s.read(<i>is</i>);  
      return <i>is</i>;
   }

   </PRE>
   because you would need an instance <tt>s</tt>, but you don't know
   the exact <i>subclass</i> until you actually executed <tt>read</tt>.

   <br><br>Because of this paradox, there is no support to implement
   virtual constructors in <tt>C++</tt>. However, one can
   implement something similar which would effectively implement
   a polymorphic read method. The term <i>virtual constructor</i>
   refers to a mechanism implemented by the programmer which can
   create instances of the run-time subclass by invoking a method
   of the base class. The <tt>clone</tt> method for your 
   second assignment -- in this sense -- is a virtual constructor.
   Virtual constructors which can create instances from streams
   are much more difficult to implement. In your second assignment,
   you had a parser, which took instantiator functions and syntax
   definitions to recognize expressions from a stream.

   <br><br>
   For this assignment, I provide you with the <i>implementation</i>
   of this mechanism. The way it works is that for every subclass
   of <tt>shape</tt>, a tiny subclass of <tt>shape_instantiator</tt>
   must be implemented which would be used by the <tt>shape::read</tt>
   method to instantiate the particular instance.

   <br><br>
   Your task is to
   <LI><b>Comment the Code I gave you [ 20 marks ]</b> 
       <UL>
          Add comments to <A HREF="shape.h">shape.h</A> and
          <A HREF="shape.cpp">shape.cpp</A> which would explain
          the person who reads the code <i>how</i> the actual
          mechanism is implemented. 
          Also add comments to <A HREF="main.cpp">main.cpp</A>
          which would explain how this is used.
          <br><br>
          Please do not do anything like
          <PRE>
  int i; // i is an integer
  for(...) // is a for loop
          </PRE>
          In-line comments are not supposed to clutter the code 
          with stating the obvious. They are specifically
          provided so the implementor can quickly re-acquaint himself
          with the code he wrote years before and to guide those
          developers who will have to maintain it. In other words,
          they should be short explanations of non-obvious mechanisms.
          If you need help how to do this, you can take a look at the
          comments in <A HREF="lexer.h">lexer.h</A> and 
          <A HREF="lexer.cpp">lexer.cpp</A> (or 
          <A HREF="../ass3/heap.h">heap.h</A> and
          <A HREF="../ass3/heap.cpp">heap.cpp</A>)
       </UL>

   <LI><b>Provide a short description [ 20 marks ]</b>
       <UL>
          Describe how virtual construction is implemented for shapes.
          You are limited to one typed page. You <i>may</i> use one diagram
          if you feel it would aid your description.
          <br><br>
          A good description is brief with <b>no code</b>. It is supposed
          to describe how one would go about implementing
          virtual construction in any object oriented language using
          inheritance, polymorphism, class methods and class variables 
          ...
       </UL>

   <LI><b>Implement the missing subclasses of <tt>shape</tt> [ 60 marks ]</b>
       <UL>
          implement <tt>rectangle</tt>, <tt>square</tt> and <tt>triangle</tt>
          so they can be read from a stream.
          <PRE>
   ass4 "circle 2" "square 2" "rectangle 4 5" "triangle  3 4 5"
          </PRE>
          should produce:
          <PRE>
   square 2  has area: 4
   triangle 3 4 5  has area: 6
   circle 2  has area: 12.5664
   rectangle 4 5  has area: 20

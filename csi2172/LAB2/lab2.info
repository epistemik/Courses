Laboratory 2: Basics   * Example 1           scope.exe [.exe]            |            +- scope1.cpp [.cpp]            |            +- scope2.cpp [.cpp]           (Unix Makfile scope.make)     Explain the output and identify the scope of each variable. (Ask the TA     for help, if you need it.)   * Example 2 (Exercise!)           loops.exe [.exe]            |            +- loops.cpp [.cpp]           (Unix Makfile loops.make)     Compile and run the program. Write a program, similar to this, which     uses all the same loop constructs abd recursion to implement power,     which calculates nk (n and k are supplied by the user)   * Example 3 (Exrecise!)           switch.exe [.exe]            |            +- switch.cpp [.cpp]            (Unix Makfile switch.make)     Modify the above program just by adding break; statements to the switch     construct so that the output is as follows:                   Exercise 1       Exercise 2       Exercise 3           input   output           output           output           a       ab               a                abcd           b       b                bc               bcd           c       cd               c                cd           d       d                def*             d           e       ef               ef*              e           f       f                f*               f*           ?       *                *                *

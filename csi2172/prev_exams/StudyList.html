<H1>MIDTERM STUDY LIST</H1>
<hr>
</CENTER>
   Start with last year's <A HREF="Winter/study.html">study list</A>
   This should convince you that it pretty much described what was on
   the actual midterms
   (<A HREF="Winter/solA.html">section A</A>, 
    <A HREF="Winter/solB.html">section B</A>)<br><br>


   This year will be no exception.

<hr>

   <LI>You will have a question to chase pointers -- <i>like question 1 
   on last year's midterm (both sections)</i>.

   <LI>You will have a question on constructors and destructors
   -- <i>like question 4 on on last year's midterm (both sections)</i>.
   I also have the perfect way to prepare for it: 
   <i>do question 1 part A on your <A HREF="../assignments/ass2">
   assignment</A></i>.

   <LI>We will have something like question 2 on last year's 
       midterms -- <i>both sections</i>, but it will be moreover like this:
   <UL>

   Suppose the variable <tt>a</tt> of type <tt>char***</tt> has the
   <i>value</i> <tt>0x2009</tt>.

   <H4>Question a</H4>
   Rewrite the following expressions in <i>pure pointer</i>
   and <i>pure array notation</i>:

   <PRE>
      1. (**(a + 1))[4]

      2. (a[2]-1)[2]

   </PRE>

   <H4>Pure Pointer Notation:</H4>
   <PRE>
      1. *(**(a+1) + 4)

      2. *(*(a+2) - 1 + 2) = *(*(a+2) + 1)
   </PRE>
      
   <H4>Pure Array Notation:</H4>
   <PRE>
      1. a[1][0][4]

      2. a[2][1]
   </PRE>

   <H4>Question b</H4>
   Where are 1. and 2. on the diagram?

   <UL>
      1. is the character value held at address <tt>0x300D</tt>
      <br><br>
      2. is the address <tt>0x2015</tt>; it is held at address
         <tt>0x3006</tt>
   </UL>

   <H4>Question c</H4>
   Write a the few lines of code which allocates this structure and
   saves it in variable <tt>char*** a</tt>.
   You may assume that the addresses returned by <tt>new</tt>
   are exactly as on the diagram. 

   <H4>One correct answer:</H4>

   <PRE>
      a = new char**[3]; // on diagram: 0x2009

      a[0] = new char*[2]; // on diagram: 0x3004

      a[1] = new char*[2]; // on diagram: 0x2002

      a[2] = a[0]; // aliasing! same address as a[0]

      a[0][0] = new char[5]; // on diagram: 0x4007
      a[0][1] = new char[4];  // on diagram: 0x2015

      a[1][0] = new char[8];  // on diagram: 0x3009
      a[1][1] = new char[7];  // on diagram: 0x400C
                            
   </PRE>

   <H4>Another correct answer:</H4>

   <PRE>
      a = new char**[3]; // on diagram: 0x2009

      a[0] = new char*[2]; // on diagram: 0x3004

      a[1] = new char*[2]; // on diagram: 0x2002

      a[2] = a[0]; // aliasing! same address as a[0]

      a[0][0] = new char[<FONT COLOR=red>12</FONT>]; // on diagram: 0x4007
      a[0][1] = new char[4];  // on diagram: 0x2015

      a[1][0] = new char[8];  // on diagram: 0x3009
      a[1][1] = <FONT COLOR=red>&a[0][0][5]</FONT>;  // or a[0][0] + 5
                              // this is aliasing too! 
   </PRE>
   </UL>

<LI>You will have to write little functions which deal with
    arrays, like in your first assignment, but nothing as long
    as <tt>quick_sort</tt>. The may involve dynamic memory allocation
    up to two dimensions and you may be asked to pass a function.
    The algorithms should pose no challange! -- you may need a loop
    or recursion.

<hr>
The bottom line is that if you go through your first assignment, study
the problems on this list and last year's midterm, you should have
no problem!

<H2>Good Luck!</H2>

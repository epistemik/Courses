<H2>What Is a Thread? </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>All programmers are familiar with writing sequential programs. 
  You've probably written a program that displays "Hello World!", or sorts a 
  list of names, or computes a list of prime numbers. These are sequential 
  programs: each has a beginning, an execution sequence, and an end. At any 
  given time during the runtime of the program there is a single point of 
  execution. 
  <P>A thread is similar to the sequential programs described previously. A 
  single thread also has a beginning, a sequence, and an end and at any given 
  time during the runtime of the thread, there is a single point of execution. 
  However, a thread itself is not a program; it cannot run on its own. Rather, 
  it runs within a program. The following figure shows this relationship.

    <STRONG>Definition:</STRONG>&nbsp; A thread is a single sequential flow of 
    control within a program. 
    <HR>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>There is nothing new in the concept of a single thread. The real hoopla 
  surrounding threads is not about a single sequential thread. Rather, it's 
  about the use of multiple threads in a single program, running at the same 
  time and performing different tasks. This is illustrated by the following 
  figure:

  <P>The HotJava Web browser is an example of a multithreaded application. 
  Within the HotJava browser you can scroll a page while it's downloading an 
  applet or image, play animation and sound concurrently, print a page in the 
  background while you download a new page, or watch three sorting algorithms 
  race to the finish. You are used to life operating in a concurrent 
  fashion...so why not your browser? 
  <P>Some texts use the name <EM>lightweight process</EM> instead of thread. A 
  thread is similar to a real process in that a thread and a running program are 
  both a single sequential flow of control. However, a thread is considered 
  lightweight because it runs within the context of a full-blown program and 
  takes advantage of the resources allocated for that program and the program's 
  environment. 
  <P>As a sequential flow of control, a thread must carve out some of its own 
  resources within a running program. (It must have its own execution stack and 
  program counter for example.) The code running within the thread works only 
  within that context. Thus, some other texts use <EM>execution context</EM> as 
  a synonym for thread. </P></BLOCKQUOTE><IMG align=bottom height=8

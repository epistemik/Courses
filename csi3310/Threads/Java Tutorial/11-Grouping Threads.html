Two or More Tasks At Once: Threads </FONT>
<H2>Grouping Threads </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Every Java thread is a member of a <EM>thread group</EM>. Thread 
  groups provide a mechanism for collecting multiple threads into a single 
  object and manipulating those threads all at once, rather than individually. 
  For example, you can start or suspend all the threads within a group with a 
  single method call. Java thread groups are implemented by the <A 
  href="D:\Program Files\JDK_122\docs\api\java\lang\ThreadGroup.html" 
  target=apidoc><FONT color=#8800bb><CODE>ThreadGroup</CODE></FONT></A><A 
  href="D:\Program Files\JDK_122\docs\api\java\lang\ThreadGroup.html" 
  target=apidoc><IMG align=absMiddle alt="(in the API reference documentation)" 
  border=0 height=11 src="Thread_files/apiIcon.gif" width=11></A> 
  class in the <CODE>java.lang</CODE> package. 
  <P>The runtime system puts a thread into a thread group during thread 
  construction. When you create a thread, you can either allow the runtime 
  system to put the new thread in some reasonable default group or you can 
  explicitly set the new thread's group. The thread is a permanent member of 
  whatever thread group it joins upon its creation--you cannot move a thread to 
  a new group after the thread has been created. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Default Thread Group</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If you create a new Thread without specifying its group in the 
  constructor, the runtime system automatically places the new thread in the 
  same group as the thread that created it (known as the <EM>current thread 
  group</EM> and the <EM>current thread</EM>, respectively). So, if you leave 
  the thread group unspecified when you create your thread, what group contains 
  your thread? 
  <P>When a Java application first starts up, the Java runtime system creates a 
  <CODE>ThreadGroup</CODE> named <CODE>main</CODE>. Unless specified otherwise, 
  all new threads that you create become members of the <CODE>main</CODE> thread 
  group. 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <HR>
    <STRONG>Note:</STRONG>&nbsp; If you create a thread within an applet, the 
    new thread's group may be something other than <CODE>main</CODE>, depending 
    on the browser or viewer that the applet is running in. Refer to <A 
    href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/applet/practical/threads.html" 
    target=_top>Threads in Applets</A><A

    target=_top><IMG align=absMiddle alt="(in the Essential Java Classes trail)" 
    border=0 height=11 src="Thread_files/tutorialIcon.gif" 
    width=11></A>for information about thread groups in applets. 
    <HR>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Many Java programmers ignore thread groups altogether and allow the runtime 
  system to handle all of the details regarding thread groups. However, if your 
  program creates a lot of threads that should be manipulated as a group, or if 
  you are implementing a custom security manager, you will likely want more 
  control over thread groups. Continue reading for more details! </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Creating a Thread Explicitly in a Group</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As mentioned previously, a thread is a permanent member of 
  whatever thread group it joins when its created--you cannot move a thread to a 
  new group after the thread has been created. Thus, if you wish to put your new 
  thread in a thread group other than the default, you must specify the thread 
  group explicitly when you create the thread. The <CODE>Thread</CODE> class has 
  three constructors that let you set a new thread's group: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>public Thread(ThreadGroup <EM>group</EM>, Runnable <EM>runnable</EM>)
public Thread(ThreadGroup <EM>group</EM>, String <EM>name</EM>)
public Thread(ThreadGroup <EM>group</EM>, Runnable <EM>runnable</EM>, String <EM>name</EM>)
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>Each of these constructors creates a new thread, 
  initializes it based on the <CODE>Runnable</CODE> and <CODE>String</CODE> 
  parameters, and makes the new thread a member of the specified group. For 
  example, the following code sample creates a thread group 
  (<CODE>myThreadGroup</CODE>) and then creates a thread (<CODE>myThread</CODE>) 
  in that group. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>ThreadGroup myThreadGroup = new ThreadGroup(
                                    "My Group of Threads");
Thread myThread = new Thread(myThreadGroup,
                             "a thread for my group");
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>The <CODE>ThreadGroup</CODE> passed into a 
  <CODE>Thread</CODE> constructor does not necessarily have to be a group that 
  you create--it can be a group created by the Java runtime system, or a group 
  created by the application in which your applet is running. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Getting a Thread's Group</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>To find out what group a thread is in, you can call its 
  <CODE>getThreadGroup</CODE> method: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>theGroup = myThread.getThreadGroup();
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The <CODE>ThreadGroup</CODE> Class</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Once you've obtained a thread's <CODE>ThreadGroup</CODE>, you can 
  query the group for information, such as what other threads are in the group. 
  You can also modify the threads in that group, such as suspending, resuming, 
  or stopping them, with a single method invocation. </BLOCKQUOTE>

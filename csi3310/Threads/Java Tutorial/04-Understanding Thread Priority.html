<H2>Understanding Thread Priority </H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Previously, this lesson claimed that threads run concurrently. 
  While conceptually this is true, in practice it usually isn't. Most computer 
  configurations have a single CPU, so threads actually run one at a time in 
  such a way as to provide an illusion of concurrency. Execution of multiple 
  threads on a single CPU, in some order, is called <EM>scheduling</EM>. The 
  Java runtime supports a very simple, deterministic scheduling algorithm known 
  as <EM>fixed priority scheduling</EM>. This algorithm schedules threads based 
  on their <EM>priority</EM> relative to other runnable threads. 
  <P>When a Java thread is created, it inherits its priority from the thread 
  that created it. You can also modify a thread's priority at any time after its 
  creation using the <CODE>setPriority</CODE> method. Thread priorities are 
  integers ranging between <CODE>MIN_PRIORITY</CODE> and 
  <CODE>MAX_PRIORITY</CODE> (constants defined in the <CODE>Thread</CODE> 
  class). The higher the integer, the higher the priority. At any given time, 
  when multiple threads are ready to be executed, the runtime system chooses the 
  runnable thread with the highest priority for execution. Only when that thread 
  stops, yields, or becomes not runnable for some reason will a lower priority 
  thread start executing. If two threads of the same priority are waiting for 
  the CPU, the scheduler chooses one of them to run in a round-robin fashion. 
  The chosen thread will run until one of the following conditions is true: 
  <UL>
    <LI>A higher priority thread becomes runnable. 
    <LI>It yields, or its <CODE>run</CODE> method exits. 
    <LI>On systems that support time-slicing, its time allotment has expired. 
    </LI></UL>Then the second thread is given a chance to run, and so on, until 
  the interpreter exits. 
  <P>The Java runtime system's thread scheduling algorithm is also 
  <EM>preemptive</EM>. If at any time a thread with a higher priority than all 
  other runnable threads becomes runnable, the runtime system chooses the new 
  higher priority thread for execution. The new higher priority thread is said 
  to <EM>preempt</EM> the other threads. 
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    <HR>
    <STRONG>Rule of thumb:</STRONG>&nbsp; At any given time, the highest 
    priority thread is running. However, this is not guaranteed. The thread 
    scheduler may choose to run a lower priority thread to avoid starvation. For 
    this reason, use priority only to affect scheduling policy for efficiency 
    purposes. Do not rely on thread priority for algorithm correctness.

<H3>A Thread Race</H3>

  src="Thread_files/sourceIcon.gif" width=11></A> is an 
  applet that animates a race between two "runner" threads with different 
  priorities. When you click the mouse down over the applet, it starts the two 
  runners. The top runner, labelled "2", has a priority of 2. The second runner, 
  labelled "3", has a priority of 3. 
  <P><STRONG>Try this:</STRONG> Click the applet below to start the race. <BR>

  target=source><FONT color=#bb000f><CODE>runners</CODE></FONT></A><A 
  href="example-swing/Runner.java"><IMG 
  align=absMiddle alt="(in a .java source file)" border=0 height=11 
  src="Thread_files/sourceIcon.gif" width=11></A>. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>public int tick = 1;
public void run() {
    while (tick &lt; 10000000)
        tick++;
} 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>This <CODE>run</CODE> method simply counts from 1 to 
  10,000,000. The instance variable <CODE>tick</CODE> is public because the 
  applet uses this value to determine how far the runner has progressed (how 
  long its line is). 
  <P>In addition to the two runner threads, this applet also has a third thread 
  that handles the drawing. The drawing thread's <CODE>run</CODE> method 
  contains an infinite loop; during each iteration of the loop it draws a line 
  for each runner (whose length is computed from the runner's <CODE>tick</CODE> 
  variable), and then sleeps for 3 milliseconds. The drawing thread has a thread 
  priority of 4--higher than either runner. So, whenever the drawing thread 
  wakes up after 3 milliseconds, it becomes the highest priority thread, 
  preempting whichever runner is currently running, and draws the lines. You can 
  see the lines inch their way across the page 
  <P>This is not a fair race because one runner has a higher priority than the 
  other. Each time the drawing thread yields the CPU by going to sleep for 3 
  milliseconds, the scheduler chooses the highest priority runnable thread to 
  run; in this case, it's always the runner with a priority of 3. Here is 
  another version of the applet that implements a fair race, that is, both of 
  the runners have the same priority and they have an equal chance of being 
  chosen to run. 
  <P><STRONG>Try this:</STRONG> Click the mouse to start the race. <BR>

  <P></P>In this race, each time the drawing thread yields the CPU by going to 
  sleep, there are two runnable threads of equal priority--the runners--waiting 
  for the CPU; the scheduler must choose one of the threads to run. In this 
  situation, the scheduler chooses the next thread to run in a round-robin 
  fashion. </BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Selfish Threads</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The <CODE>Runner</CODE> class used in the races above actually 
  implements "socially-impaired" thread behavior. Recall the <CODE>run</CODE> 
  method from the Runner class used in the races above: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>public int tick = 1;
public void run() {
    while (tick &lt; 10000000)
        tick++;
} 
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>The <CODE>while</CODE> loop in the <CODE>run</CODE> method 
  is in a tight loop. Once the scheduler chooses a thread with this thread body 
  for execution, the thread never voluntarily relinquishes control of the 
  CPU--the thread continues to run until the <CODE>while</CODE> loop terminates 
  naturally or until the thread is preempted by a higher priority thread. This 
  thread is called a <EM>selfish thread</EM>. 
  <P>In some situations, having selfish threads doesn't cause any problems 
  because a higher priority thread preempts the selfish one (just as the drawing 
  thread in the RaceApplet preempts the selfish runners). However, in other 
  situations, threads with CPU-greedy <CODE>run</CODE> methods, such as the 
  <CODE>Runner</CODE> class, can take over the CPU and cause other threads to 
  wait for a long time before getting a chance to run. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Time-Slicing</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some systems, such as Windows 95/NT, fight selfish thread behavior 
  with a strategy known as <EM>time-slicing</EM>. Time-slicing comes into play 
  when there are multiple "Runnable" threads of equal priority and those threads 
  are the highest priority threads competing for the CPU. For example, this <A 
  href="example/RaceTest.java" 
  target=source><FONT color=#bb000f><CODE>stand-alone Java 
  program</CODE></FONT></A><A 
  href="example/RaceTest.java"><IMG 
  align=absMiddle alt="(in a .java source file)" border=0 height=11 
  src="Thread_files/sourceIcon.gif" width=11></A> (which 
  is based on the RaceApplet above) creates two equal priority <A 
  href="example/SelfishRunner.java" 
  target=source><FONT color=#bb000f><CODE>selfish threads</CODE></FONT></A><A 
  href="example/SelfishRunner.java"><IMG 
  align=absMiddle alt="(in a .java source file)" border=0 height=11 
  src="Thread_files/sourceIcon.gif" width=11></A> that 
  have the following <CODE>run</CODE> method. 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>public void run() {
    while (tick &lt; 400000) {
        tick++;
        if ((tick % 50000) == 0)
            System.out.println("Thread #" + num
                               + ", tick = " + tick);
    }
}    
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>This <CODE>run</CODE> contains a tight loop that increments 
  the integer <CODE>tick</CODE> and every 50,000 ticks prints out the thread's 
  identifier and its <CODE>tick</CODE> count. 
  <P>When running this program on a time-sliced system, you will see messages 
  from both threads intermingled with one another. Like this: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Thread #1, tick = 50000
Thread #0, tick = 50000
Thread #0, tick = 100000
Thread #1, tick = 100000
Thread #1, tick = 150000
Thread #1, tick = 200000
Thread #0, tick = 150000
Thread #0, tick = 200000
Thread #1, tick = 250000
Thread #0, tick = 250000
Thread #0, tick = 300000
Thread #1, tick = 300000
Thread #1, tick = 350000
Thread #0, tick = 350000
Thread #0, tick = 400000
Thread #1, tick = 400000
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>This output is produced because a time-sliced system 
  divides the CPU into time slots and iteratively gives each of the 
  equal-and-highest priority threads a time slot in which to run. The 
  time-sliced system iterates through the equal-and-highest priority threads, 
  allowing each one a bit of time to run, until one or more of them finishes or 
  until a higher priority thread preempts them. Notice that time-slicing makes 
  no guarantees as to how often or in what order threads are scheduled to run. 
  <P>When running this program on a non-time-sliced system, however, you will 
  see messages from one thread finish printing before the other thread ever gets 
  a chance to print one message. Like this: 
  <BLOCKQUOTE><PRE>Thread #0, tick = 50000
Thread #0, tick = 100000
Thread #0, tick = 150000
Thread #0, tick = 200000
Thread #0, tick = 250000
Thread #0, tick = 300000
Thread #0, tick = 350000
Thread #0, tick = 400000
Thread #1, tick = 50000
Thread #1, tick = 100000
Thread #1, tick = 150000
Thread #1, tick = 200000
Thread #1, tick = 250000
Thread #1, tick = 300000
Thread #1, tick = 350000
Thread #1, tick = 400000
</PRE></BLOCKQUOTE>This is because a non-time-sliced system chooses one of the 
  equal-and-highest priority threads to run and allows that thread to run until 
  it relinquishes the CPU (by sleeping, yielding, finishing its job) or until a 
  higher priority preempts it.

    <STRONG>Note:</STRONG>&nbsp; The Java runtime does not implement (and 
    therefore does not guarantee) time-slicing. However, some systems on which 
    you can run Java do support time-slicing. Your Java programs should not rely 
    on time-slicing as it may produce different results on different systems.

  <P>As you can imagine, writing CPU-intensive code can have negative 
  repercussions on other threads running in the same process. In general, you 
  should try to write "well-behaved" threads that voluntarily relinquish the CPU 
  periodically and give other threads an opportunity to run. In particular, you 
  should never write Java code that relies on time-sharing--this will 
  practically guarantee that your program will give different results on 
  different computer systems. 
  <P>A thread can voluntarily yield the CPU without going to sleep or some other 
  drastic means by calling the <CODE>yield</CODE> method. The <CODE>yield</CODE> 
  method gives other threads of the same priority a chance to run. If there are 
  no equal priority threads that are runnable, then the yield is ignored.

<H3>Summary</H3>
<UL>
  <LI>Most computers have only one CPU, so threads must share the CPU with other 
  threads. The execution of multiple threads on a single CPU, in some order, is 
  called scheduling. The Java runtime supports a very simple, deterministic 
  scheduling algorithm known as fixed priority scheduling. 
  <LI>Each Java thread is given a numeric priority between 
  <CODE>MIN_PRIORITY</CODE> and <CODE>MAX_PRIORITY</CODE> (constants defined in 
  the <CODE>Thread</CODE> class). At any given time, when multiple threads are 
  ready to be executed, the thread with the highest priority is chosen for 
  execution. Only when that thread stops, or is suspended for some reason, will 
  a lower priority thread start executing. 
  <LI>Scheduling of the CPU is fully preemptive. If a thread with a higher 
  priority than the currently executing thread needs to execute, the higher 
  priority thread is immediately scheduled. 
  <LI>The Java runtime will not preempt the currently running thread for another 
  thread of the same priority. In other words, the Java runtime does not 
  time-slice. However, the system implementation of threads underlying the Java 
  Thread class may support time-slicing. Do not write code that relies on 
  time-slicing. 
  <LI>In addition, a given thread may, at any time, give up its right to execute 
  by calling the <CODE>yield</CODE> method. Threads can only yield the CPU to 
  other threads of the same priority--attempts to yield to a lower priority 
  thread are ignored. 
  <LI>When all the runnable threads in the system have the same priority, the 
  scheduler chooses the next thread to run in a simple, non-preemptive, 
  round-robin scheduling order. </LI></UL>

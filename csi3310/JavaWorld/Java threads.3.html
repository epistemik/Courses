<A href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-1998/jw-10-toolbox.html">last 
month's column</A>, I demonstrated a simple deadlock scenario using two nested 
<CODE>synchronized</CODE> blocks that acquired the same two locks, but in a 
different order. (Please review last month's example if this isn't fresh in your 
mind.) This month, I'll take a look at a solution to this commonplace deadlock 
problem, presenting a roll-your-own exclusion semaphore class and a lock manager 
that supports the safe acquisition of multiple semaphores. Using these objects 
rather than the built-in <CODE>synchronized</CODE> can save you hours of 
searching for unexpected deadlocks. (They don't solve every possible deadlock 
problem, of course, but are nonetheless pretty useful.) 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>When 'synchronized' isn't good 
enough</STRONG></FONT><BR>The nested-<CODE>synchronized</CODE>-statements 
example from last month was -- admittedly -- contrived, but the multiple-lock 
situation comes up frequently in the real world. One common problem is the 
too-coarse, object-level granularity of the <CODE>synchronized</CODE> keyword: 
there's only one monitor per object, and sometimes that's not enough. 
<P>Consider the following class, the methods of which can be broken up into 
three partitions. The methods in the first partition use only a subset of the 
fields in the class. The methods in the second partition use a non-overlapping 
subset; they share fields that are not used by methods in the first partition. 
The methods in the third partition use everything. 
<P><CODE>1| class Complicated <EM>// NOT thread safe</EM><BR>2| {<BR>3| private 
long a, b;<BR>4| private long x, y;<BR>5| <BR>6| <EM>// partition 1, functions 
use a and/or b</EM><BR>7| <BR>8| public void use_a() { do_something_with(a); ); 
}<BR>9| public void use_b() { do_something_with(b); ); }<BR>10 public void 
use_a_and_b() { do_something_with(a+b); ); }<BR>11| <BR>12| <EM>// partition 2, 
functions use x and/or y</EM><BR>13| <BR>14| public void use_x() { 
do_something_with(x); ); }<BR>15| public void use_y() { do_something_with(y); ); 
}<BR>16| public void use_x_and_y() { do_something_with(x+y); ); }<BR>17| <BR>18| 
<EM>// partition 3, functions use a, b, x, and y</EM><BR>19| <BR>20| public void 
use_everything() { do_something_with( a +<BR>x ); }<BR>21| public void 
use_everything_else(){ do_something_with( b +<BR>y ); }<BR>22| }<BR></CODE>
<P>As it stands, this code is a multithreading disaster. Nothing is synchronized 
and we have guaranteed race conditions. (A <EM>race condition</EM> occurs when 
two threads try to access the same object at the same time, and chance 
determines which one wins the "race." Programs shouldn't work by chance.) 
Synchronizing all the methods would fix the problem, but then you couldn't call 
a method in <EM>partition 1</EM> (emphasized in the code above) simply because 
some thread was using a method from <EM>partition 2 above.</EM> Since these two 
partitions don't interact with each other, this solution imposes needless access 
restrictions on the methods of the class. If you're accessing any method in 
partition 3, though, you do want to lock out everything in the other two 
partitions. We really need two locks in this situation. One to lock partition-1 
variables and another for partition-2 variables. The methods in partition 3 can 
then grab both locks. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>So, roll your own</STRONG></FONT><BR>You can implement 
the two-lock strategy by synchronizing on something other than the containing 
object. Rather than synchronizing the methods, you can define two local 
variables to use as locks and synchronize on them: 
<P><CODE>1| class Complicated_and_thread_safe<BR>2| {<BR>3| private long a, 
b;<BR>4| private long x, y;<BR>5| <BR>6| private Object ab_lock = new 
int[];<BR>7| private Object xy_lock = new int[];<BR>8| <BR>9| <EM>// partition 
1, functions use a and/or b</EM><BR>10| <BR>11| public void use_a() { 
synchronized(ab_lock){<BR>&nbsp;<EM>/*...*/</EM> } } <BR>12| public void use_b() 
{ synchronized(ab_lock){<BR><EM>/*...*/</EM> } } <BR>13| public void 
use_a_and_b(){ synchronized(ab_lock){<BR><EM>/*...*/</EM> } } <BR>14| <BR>15| 
<EM>// partition 2, functions use x and/or y</EM><BR>16| <BR>17| public void 
use_x() { synchronized(xy_lock){<BR>&nbsp;<EM>/*...*/</EM> } }<BR>18| public 
void use_y() { synchronized(xy_lock){<BR><EM>/*...*/</EM> } }<BR>19| public void 
use_x_and_y(){ synchronized(xy_lock){<BR><EM>/*...*/</EM> } }<BR>20| <BR>21| 
<EM>// partition 3, functions use a, b, x, and y</EM><BR>22| <BR>23| public void 
use_everything()<BR>24| { synchronized(ab_lock) <EM>// grab both 
locks</EM><BR>25| { synchronized(xy_lock)<BR>26| { <EM>/*...*/</EM><BR>27| 
}<BR>28| }<BR>29| }<BR>30| <BR>31| public void use_everything_else()<BR>32| { 
synchronized(ab_lock)<BR>33| { synchronized(xy_lock)<BR>34| { 
<EM>/*...*/</EM><BR>35| }<BR>36| }<BR>37| }<BR>38| }<BR></CODE>
<P>I haven't synchronized the methods themselves in this example. (Remember, 
synchronizing a method is effectively the same thing as wrapping all the code in 
the method in a <CODE>synchronized(this){...}</CODE> block.) Instead, I'm 
providing a unique lock for each partition (<CODE>ab_lock</CODE> and 
<CODE>xy_lock</CODE>) and then explicitly synchronizing on these individual 
locks. 
<P>Java associates locks with objects (instance of some class that extends 
<CODE>Object</CODE>, so I can't use primitive-type variables as locks here. I 
don't want to spend unnecessary time calling constructors and doing other 
initialization operations on complicated objects, however. Consequently, the 
locks themselves are declared as the simplest possible <CODE>Object</CODE> -- an 
array. 
<P>Arrays in Java are first-class objects: they implicitly extend the 
<CODE>Object</CODE> class. (If you don't believe me, compile the following code: 

<P><CODE>1| public class foo<BR>2| { static Object ref = new int[]{ 10 };<BR>3| 
<BR>4| public static void main( String[] args )<BR>5| { System.out.println( 
ref.toString() );<BR>6| }<BR>7| }<BR></CODE>
<P>The class compiles just fine. Not only does the implicit cast from the array 
to <CODE>Object</CODE> work (because <CODE>Object</CODE> is a base class of all 
arrays), but the <CODE>println()</CODE> correctly invokes the compiler-generated 
<CODE>toString()</CODE> override (which prints absolutely nothing useful -- but 
you can't have everything). I've used a one-element array for my lock, rather 
than something like an <CODE>Integer</CODE>, because arrays come into existence 
very efficiently. For example, there's no constructor call. 
<P>In the foregoing example, it's <EM>critical</EM> that methods that acquire 
both locks always acquire them in the same order, otherwise we end up in the 
Wilma-and-Betty deadlock scenario discussed <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-10-1998/jw-10-toolbox.html">last 
month</A>. Acquiring multiple locks is a commonplace enough problem that some 
operating systems have system calls for this purpose. It would be nice to have 
an easy way to acquire multiple locks, in Java, without having to worry about 
the order-of-acquisition problem. The remainder of this month's column describes 
one way to do that.

<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Semaphores</STRONG></FONT><BR>Listing 1 shows the core 
interface I use for all my roll-your-own semaphore classes: the 
<CODE>Semaphore</CODE>. It's in the <EM>com.holub.asynch</EM> package, as are 
all the thread-related classes and interfaces I'll be discussing. (I've also put 
all the code that appears in the listings into the "Goodies" section on my Web 
site; see <A 
href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-11-1998/jw-11-toolbox_p.html#resources">Resources</A>

<P><STRONG><EM>Listing 1: Semaphore.java</EM></STRONG> 
<P>If you haven't worked much with semaphores, a semaphore has to have two 
properties in order to be useful: 
<P>
<OL>
  <LI>It must be able to identify itself using a unique ID when passed an 
  <CODE>id()</CODE> request. The current implementation uses a unique integer 
  for the purpose. 
  <P></P>
  <LI>You must be able to acquire and release the semaphore, though the semantic 
  meaning of "acquire" and "release" can vary, depending on what sort of 
  semaphore you're dealing with. </LI></OL>
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Managing the locks</STRONG></FONT><BR>Any semaphore 
that implements <CODE>Semaphore</CODE> can be locked in groups using the 
<CODE>Lock_manager</CODE> class shown in Listing 2. There are several things 
going on here. First of all, I've used the <CODE>Arrays.sort()</CODE> method, 
one of the new JDK 1.2 data-structure facilities, to make life easier. The 
<CODE>Arrays</CODE> class is a "Booch utility" -- a class that contains nothing 
but static methods. The <EM>java.lang.Math</EM> utility is another example. In 
fact, the <CODE>Lock_manager</CODE> itself is a utility, since it's made up 
solely of static methods.

<P><STRONG><EM>Listing 2: Lock_manager.java</EM></STRONG> 
<P><STRONG>"Booch utilities"</STRONG><BR>Digressing for a moment, in most 
object-oriented languages, utilities are kludges needed to get around design 
problems in the language itself or in existing libraries. The problem in Java is 
that neither arrays nor primitive types really are true objects. If they were, 
they would contain all the methods needed to manipulate them. For example, you 
would be able to find a cosine using: 
<P><CODE>int x = PI;<BR>x.cosine();<BR></CODE>
<P>You'd also be able to extend <CODE>int</CODE>, and so forth. In the case of 
arrays, you ought to be able to sort them by asking them to sort themselves, 
like this: 
<P><CODE>int array[] = new int[];<BR><EM>//...</EM><BR>array.sort();<BR></CODE>
<P>Unfortunately, Java isn't a "pure" object-oriented language in which 
everything is an object, so we have to make do with a utility class. 
<P>You can use the <CODE>Arrays</CODE> utility as follows to sort an array of 
<CODE>int</CODE>: 
<P><CODE>int array[] = new int[];<BR><EM>//...</EM><BR>Arrays.sort( array 
);<BR></CODE>
<P>The problem is complicated a bit by arrays of objects of some arbitrary 
class. How can a generic sort utility figure out the correct ordering? The 
<CODE>Object</CODE> class contains an <CODE>equals()</CODE> function, but we'd 
need a <CODE>greater_than()</CODE> as well to do sorting. 
<P><STRONG>The Strategy pattern</STRONG><BR>To the rescue comes the "Strategy" 
pattern. The notion is to pass into a method or object another object that 
encapsulates the strategy needed to do something. There are lots of examples of 
Strategy in Java. A <CODE>java.awt.LayoutManager</CODE>, for example, 
encapsulates the strategy that a <CODE>Frame</CODE> uses for laying itself out. 
You can change the layout simply by changing this strategy. You don't have to 
define a new kind of <CODE>Frame</CODE> class using derivation or some other 
mechanism. This, in turn, makes <CODE>Frame</CODE> much more "reusable" since 
the behavior of a <CODE>Frame</CODE> can be changed without changing any of the 
code that comprises <CODE>Frame</CODE>. 
<P>The <CODE>Arrays</CODE> utility uses the Strategy pattern to define a 
comparison strategy. In Listing 2, the <CODE>Lock_comparator</CODE> (at the 
bottom of the listing) implements the comparison strategy by implementing the 
new (to JDK 1.2) <CODE>java.util.Comparator</CODE> interface and its 
<CODE>compare()</CODE> method. (This works like C's <CODE>strcmp()</CODE>: it 
returns a negative number, zero, or a positive number depending on whether 
<EM>a</EM> is less than, equal to, or greater than <EM>b</EM>.) An instance of 
the <CODE>Comparator</CODE> is passed to the <CODE>Arrays.sort()</CODE> method 
like this: 
<P><CODE>Arrays.sort(locks, new Lock_comparator() );<BR></CODE>
<P>The <CODE>Lock_comparator</CODE> object's <CODE>compare()</CODE> method is 
called by <CODE>Arrays.sort()</CODE> when it needs to compare objects. C 
programmers will recognize this approach as very similar to that of 
<CODE>qsort()</CODE>, which is passed a pointer to a compare method -- another 
example of Strategy. 
<P><STRONG>How <CODE>Lock_manager</CODE> works</STRONG><BR>Now, let's look at 
what the <CODE>Lock_manager</CODE> actually does. It starts out with the static 
<CODE>new_id()</CODE> method that returns a unique <CODE>int</CODE> every time 
it's called. This method will be called from the various objects that implement 
the <CODE>Semaphore</CODE> interface to get the value they'll use for their ID. 
<P>The <CODE>acquire</CODE> multiple method is used to safely acquire groups of 
semaphores. You pass it an array of objects that implement 
<CODE>Semaphore</CODE>, it sorts the array by ID, and then acquires the 
semaphores one at a time in ID order. Consistent acquisition of multiple 
semaphores in ID order effectively eliminates the deadlock scenario we've been 
discussing. 
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>A manageable mutex</STRONG></FONT><BR>Now let's move on 
and look at the other side of the equation: a class that implements a semaphore. 
The <CODE>Mutex</CODE> class in Listing 3 implements a simple mutual-exclusion 
semaphore. Whether it makes sense to use it (as compared to synchronizing on a 
lock object, as I did earlier) really depends on the situation. The main 
advantage is in being able to use the 
<CODE>Lock_manager.acquire_multiple()</CODE> to acquire several mutexes without 
worrying about an order-of-acquisition deadlock. I personally think the code 
also looks a little cleaner. I prefer this: 
<P><CODE>1| class some_class<BR>2| { <BR>3| private Mutex lock = new 
Mutex();<BR>4| <BR>5| public void f()<BR>6| { lock.acquire();<BR>7| 
<EM>//...</EM><BR>8| lock.release();<BR>9| }<BR>10| }<BR></CODE>
<P>to this: 
<P><CODE>1| class some_class<BR>2| {<BR>3| private Object lock = new 
int[1];<BR>4| <BR>5| public void f()<BR>6| { synchronized( lock )<BR>7| {<BR>8| 
<EM>//...</EM><BR>9| }<BR>10| }<BR>11| }<BR></CODE>

<P><STRONG><EM>Listing 3: Mutex.java</EM></STRONG> 
<P>Admittedly, this preference for the explicit call to <CODE>acquire()</CODE> 
is largely a matter of personal taste. We'll look at a few other semaphore 
implementations next month that are a bit harder to simulate with a simple 
<CODE>synchronized</CODE>, however. 
<P>Getting back to Listing 3, the <CODE>Mutex</CODE> class starts out with the 
stuff needed to keep the <CODE>Lock_manager</CODE> happy. It implements the 
<CODE>Semaphore</CODE> interface with an <CODE>id()</CODE> method that returns 
the value of the <CODE>_id</CODE> field, which in turn holds a unique value that 
came from the <CODE>Lock_manager</CODE>. 
<P>There are two versions of the <CODE>acquire</CODE> method: 
<CODE>acquire()</CODE> itself and <CODE>acquire_without_blocking()</CODE>. The 
latter simply returns <EM>false</EM> if it can't acquire the mutex. If the mutex 
isn't owned, it sets <CODE>owner</CODE> to reference the thread that called 
<CODE>acquire_without_blocking()</CODE> with the call to 
<CODE>Thread.currentThread()</CODE>, which does the obvious. The blocking 
version, <CODE>acquire()</CODE>, calls the nonblocking version and suspends 
itself with a <CODE>wait()</CODE> call if it can't get the mutex right off the 
bat. Note the use of a spin lock here. (I discussed spin locks last month.) The 
<CODE>wait()</CODE> call is inside a loop in case some other thread breaks in at 
an inopportune moment and steals the mutex. 
<P>Interestingly, the <CODE>Mutex</CODE> code doesn't actually use the 
<CODE>Mutex</CODE> object's monitor to implement the lock (though it does use 
the monitor to make sure that two threads don't try to acquire the same mutex 
simultaneously -- <CODE>acquire()</CODE> and <CODE>release()</CODE> are 
<CODE>synchronized</CODE>). A local field called <CODE>owner</CODE> is used to 
decide whether or not to block out an acquiring thread. The <CODE>owner</CODE> 
field references the <CODE>Thread</CODE> instance that contains the 
<CODE>run()</CODE> method for a given thread. If <CODE>owner</CODE> is 
<CODE>null</CODE>, the mutex is up for grabs, otherwise, some thread "owns" the 
mutex and any other thread that tries to acquire it will block at the 
<CODE>wait()</CODE> call in <CODE>acquire()</CODE>. 
<P>My <CODE>Mutex</CODE> class implements a "recursive" mutex. The "owner" 
thread can acquire the mutex more than once, but it must release the mutex by 
calling <CODE>release()</CODE> as many times as it acquired it by calling 
<CODE>acquire()</CODE>. 
<P>This facility is essential when two methods both must acquire the mutex. In 
the following code, for example, <CODE>g()</CODE> calls <CODE>f()</CODE>, but 
<CODE>f()</CODE> can also be called from outside -- without going through 
<CODE>g()</CODE> first. If the mutex weren't recursive, the thread that called 
<CODE>g()</CODE> would block when <CODE>g()</CODE> called <CODE>f()</CODE> and 
tried to acquire the mutex a second time. As it is, the double acquisition isn't 
a problem since every <CODE>acquire()</CODE> has a corresponding 
<CODE>release()</CODE>. The <CODE>lock_count</CODE> field keeps track of the 
number of times the mutex has been locked by its owner. 
<P><CODE>1| class some_class<BR>2| { Mutex lock = new Mutex();<BR>3| <BR>4| 
public void f()<BR>5| { lock.acquire();<BR>6| <EM>//...</EM><BR>7| 
lock.release();<BR>8| }<BR>9| <BR>10| public void g()<BR>11| { 
lock.acquire();<BR>12| <EM>//...</EM><BR>13| f();<BR>14| <EM>//...</EM><BR>15| 
lock.release();<BR>16| }<BR>17| }<BR></CODE>
<P><FONT size=+1><STRONG>Until next time</STRONG></FONT><BR>So that's a simple 
roll-your-own semaphore. Though it's easy enough to use Java's 
<CODE>synchronized</CODE> statement directly to do everything the 
<CODE>Mutex</CODE> does, the code is cleaner when you use the <CODE>Mutex</CODE> 
class, and the associated <CODE>Lock_manager</CODE> can solve a class of 
otherwise hard-to-manage deadlock problems. 
<P>Next month I'll look at a couple of other useful semaphores: a condition 
variable and a Djikstra counting semaphore. I'll also discuss critical sections 
and class-level locks. In future columns, we'll take a look at other 
thread-related classes, such as timers and reader/writer locks, and explore 
architectural solutions to threading-related problems. <IMG height=8

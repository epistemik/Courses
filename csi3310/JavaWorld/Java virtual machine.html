A key component of Java is the Java Virtual Machine --  a virtual
computer, typically implemented in software on top of  a
&quotreal&quot hardware platform and operating system,  that
runs compiled Java programs. Thanks to the JVM, programs written
in Java don't have to be rewritten to run on different computers.
Here's a hands-on  introduction to the JVM. (<EM>1,500 words</EM>)

<IMG ALIGN="LEFT" width="40" height="29" SRC="/javaworld/abcs/W.gif" ALT="W">elcome to the  
first installment of &quotUnder The Hood.&quot In this  
column I'd like to explore topics concerning the inner  
workings of Java. Each month I'll focus on one area and  
attempt to demystify it. My aim is to help programmers  
understand what is actually going on when they compile and  
run their Java programs. In this installment, I provide  
an introduction to the basic structure and functionality  
of the Java Virtual Machine.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>What is the Java Virtual Machine? Why is it here?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, is an abstract  
computer that runs compiled Java programs. The JVM is  
&quotvirtual&quot because it is generally implemented in  
software on top of a &quotreal&quot hardware platform  
and operating system. All Java programs are compiled for  
the JVM. Therefore, the JVM must be implemented on a  
particular platform before compiled Java programs will run  
on that platform. </p>
<P>
<center><img width="342" height="92" src="/javaworld/jw-06-1996/vmsupport/images/Sandwich.gif"></center>
<P>
The JVM plays a central role in making Java portable.  
It provides a layer of abstraction between the compiled  
Java program and the underlying hardware platform and  
operating system. The JVM is central to Java's portability  
because compiled Java programs run on the JVM,  
independent of whatever may be underneath a particular  
JVM&nbspimplementation.</p>
<P>
What makes the JVM lean and mean? The JVM&nbspis lean  
because it is small when implemented in software. It was  
designed to be small so that it can fit in as many places  
as possible -- places like TV sets, cell phones, and  
personal computers. The JVM is mean because it of its  
ambition. "Ubiquity!" is its battle cry. It wants to be  
everywhere, and its success is indicated by the extent to  
which programs written in Java will run everywhere.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Java bytecodes</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Java programs are compiled into a form called Java  
bytecodes. The JVM&nbspexecutes Java bytecodes, so Java  
bytecodes can be thought of as the machine language of the  
JVM. The Java compiler reads Java language source (.java)  
files, translates the source into Java bytecodes, and  
places the bytecodes into class (.class) files. The  
compiler generates one class file per class in the  
source.</p>
<P>
<center><img width="367" height="80" src="/javaworld/jw-06-1996/vmsupport/images/Filter.gif" ></center>
<P>
To the JVM, a stream of bytecodes is a sequence of  
instructions. Each instruction consists of a one-byte  
opcode and zero or more operands. The opcode tells the JVM  
what action to take. If the JVM requires more information  
to perform the action than just the opcode, the required  
information immediately follows the opcode as  
operands.</p>
<P>
A mnemonic is defined for each bytecode instruction.  
The mnemonics can be thought of as an assembly language  
for the JVM. For example, there is an instruction that  
will cause the JVM to push a zero onto the stack. The  
mnemonic for this instruction is  
<strong>iconst_0</strong>, and its bytecode value is  
<strong>60</strong> hex. This instruction takes no  
operands. Another instruction causes program execution to  
unconditionally jump forward or backward in memory. This  
instruction requires one operand, a 16-bit signed offset  
from the current memory location. By adding the offset to  
the current memory location, the JVM can determine the  
memory location to jump to. The mnemonic for this  
instruction is <strong>goto</strong>, and its bytecode  
value is <strong>a7</strong> hex.</p>
<P>
<center><img width="511" height="99" src="/javaworld/jw-06-1996/vmsupport/images/Bytecode.gif" ></center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Virtual parts</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The &quotvirtual hardware&quot of the Java Virtual  
Machine can be divided into four basic parts: the  
registers, the stack, the garbage-collected heap, and the  
method area. These parts are abstract, just like the  
machine they compose, but they must exist in some form in  
every JVM implementation.</p>
<P>
The size of an address in the JVM is 32 bits.The JVM  
can, therefore, address up to 4 gigabytes (2 to the power  
of 32) of memory, with each memory location containing one  
byte. Each register in the JVM stores one 32-bit address.  
The stack, the garbage-collected heap, and the method  
area reside somewhere within the 4 gigabytes of  
addressable memory. The exact location of these memory  
areas is a decision of the   
implementor of each particular JVM.</p>
<P>
A word in the Java Virtual Machine is 32 bits. The JVM  
has a small number of primitive data types: byte (8  
bits), short (16 bits), int (32 bits), long (64 bits),  
float (32 bits), double (64 bits), and char (16 bits).  
With the exception of char, which is an unsigned Unicode  
character, all the numeric types are signed. These types  
conveniently map to the types available to the Java  
programmer. One other primitive type is the object handle,  
which is a 32-bit address that refers to an object on the heap.</p>
<P>
The method area, because it contains bytecodes, is  
aligned on byte boundaries. The stack and  
garbage-collected heap are aligned on word (32-bit)  
boundaries.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The proud, the few, the registers</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The JVM has a program counter and three registers that  
manage the stack. It has few registers because the  
bytecode instructions of the JVM operate primarily on the  
stack. This stack-oriented design helps keep the JVM's  
instruction set and implementation small.</p>
<P>
The JVM&nbspuses the program counter, or pc register,  
to keep track of where in memory it should be executing  
instructions. The other three registers -- optop register,  
frame register, and vars register -- point to various  
parts of the stack frame of the currently executing  
method. The stack frame of an executing method holds the  
state (local variables, intermediate results of  
calculations, etc.) for a particular invocation of the  
method.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The method area and the program counter</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The method area is where the bytecodes reside. The  
program counter always points to (contains the address of)  
some byte in the method area. The program counter is used  
to keep track of the thread of execution. After a  
bytecode instruction has been executed, the program  
counter will contain the address of the next instruction  
to execute. After execution of an instruction, the JVM  
sets the program counter to the address of the instruction  
that immediately follows the previous one, unless the  
previous one specifically demanded a jump.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The Java stack and related registers</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The Java stack is used to store parameters for and  
results of bytecode instructions, to pass parameters to  
and return values from methods, and to keep the state of  
each method invocation. The state of a method invocation  
is called its stack frame. The vars, frame, and optop  
registers point to different parts of the current stack  
frame.</p>
<P>
There are three sections in a Java stack frame: the  
local variables, the execution environment, and the operand  
stack. The local variables section contains all the local  
variables being used by the current method invocation.   
It is pointed to by the vars register. The execution  
environment section is used to maintain the operations of  
the stack itself. It is pointed to by the frame register.  
The operand stack is used as a work space by bytecode  
instructions. It is here that the parameters for bytecode  
instructions are placed, and results of bytecode  
instructions are found. The top of the operand stack is  
pointed to by the optop register.</p>
<P>
The execution environment is usually sandwiched  
between the local variables and the operand stack. The  
operand stack of the currently executing method is always  
the topmost stack section, and the optop register  
therefore always points to the top of the entire Java  
stack.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The garbage-collected heap</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The heap is where the objects of a Java program live.  
Any time you allocate memory with the <strong>new</strong>  
operator, that memory comes from the heap. The Java  
language doesn't allow you to free allocated memory  
directly. Instead, the runtime environment keeps track of  
the references to each object on the heap, and  
automatically frees the memory occupied by objects that  
are no longer referenced -- a process called garbage  
collection.</p>
<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Eternal math: a JVM simulation</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The applet below simulates a JVM executing a few  
bytecode instructions. The instructions in the simulation  
were generated by the javac compiler given the following  
java code:</p>
<P>
<code>
class Act {<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppublic static void doMathForever() {<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspint i = 0;<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhile (true) {<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi += 1;<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspi *= 2;<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp}<BR>
}<BR>
</code>
<P>
The instructions in the simulation represent the body  
of the doMathForever() method. These instructions were  
chosen because they are a short sequence of bytecodes that  
do something mildly interesting on the stack. This  
simulation stars the registers, the stack, and the method  
area. The heap is not involved in this bytecode sequence,  
so it is not shown as part of the applet's user interface.  
All numbers in the simulation are shown in hex.</p>
<P>
As our story opens, the program counter (pc  
register)&nbspis pointing to an <strong>iconst_0</strong>  
instruction. The <strong>iconst_0</strong> instruction is  
in the method area, where bytecodes like to hang out.</p>
<P>
When you press the Step button, the JVM will execute  
the single instruction that is being pointed to by the  
program counter. So, the first time you press the Step  
button, the <strong>iconst_0</strong> instruction, which  
pushes a zero onto the stack, will be executed. After this  
instruction has executed,the program counter will be  
pointing to the next instruction to execute.Subsequent  
presses of the Step button will execute subsequent  
instructions and the program counter will lead the way.  
Pressing the Reset button will cause the simulation to  
start over at the beginning.</p>
<P>
The value of each register is shown two ways. The  
contents of each register, a 32-bit address, is shown in  
hex across the top of the simulation. Additionally,  
I&nbspput a small pointer to the address contained in  
each register next to the address in either the stack or  
the method area. The address contained by the program  
counter, for example, has a <strong>pc&gt</strong> next  
to it in the method area.</p>
<P>
The Java stack is word-based. Each time something is  
pushed onto the Java stack, it goes on as a word (although  
longs and doubles actually go on as two words). In the  
simulation, the Java stack is shown as an upside-down  
tower of words. It is shown growing down the panel (up in  
memory addresses) as words are pushed onto it. The stack  
recedes back up the panel as words are popped from it. In  
this implementation of the JVM, the optop register always  
points to the next available slot on the Java stack.</p>
<P>
All three sections of the stack frame for the  
currently executing method-- the local variables, the  
execution environment, and the operand stack -- are shown  
in the simulation. Only the local variables and operand  
stack take part in this simulation, though. The execution  
environment isn't involved in this particular bytecode  
sequence, so it is shown filled with zeros.</p>
<P>
The local variables section of the Java stack is  
treated as an array of words starting at the location  
pointed to by the vars register. Bytecodes that deal with  
local variables generally include an array index, which is  
an offset from the vars register. The address of the nth  
local variable is (vars + (n *&nbsp4)). You must multiply  
n by 4, because each word is 4 bytes long. </p>
<P>
The doMathForever() method has only one local  
variable, i. It is therefore at array position zero and is  
pointed to directly by the vars register. For example,  
the iinc instruction takes two byte-sized operands, a  
local variable index and an amount. In the simulation,  
&quotiinc 0 1&quot increments by one the integer at  
local variable array position zero. This instruction  
implements the &quoti += 1;&quot statement from  
doMathForever().</p>
<P>
With enough patience and clicks of the Step button,  
you can get an arithmetic overflow. When the JVM  
encounters such a condition, it just truncates, as is  
shown by this simulation. No exceptions are thrown.  
(Actually, I am just displaying the result of a multiply  
operation performed by the &quotreal&quot JVM in your  
browser.)</p>
<P>
I put a text description of each step at the bottom of  
the applet, which I hope will help to carry you through  
the simulation with clarity and deep understanding. Happy  
clicking.</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<STRONG>Summary</STRONG><BR>
This article, the second in a multipart series on threads, discusses
the perils that can arise when you approach multithreading in a naive
way.  As is the case with the entire series, this article assumes
reader familiarity with the basic thread-related parts of Java: the
<code>synchronized</code> keyword and monitors, <code>wait()</code>,
<code>notify()</code>, the basics of using the <code>Thread</code>
class, and so forth. Here, Allen focuses on the more advanced problems
encountered when programming Java threads in the real world.

<p>
<strong>Editors' note:</strong> Due to the overwhelming and
enthusiastic response from readers who read Allen Holub's Part 1
article on threads, <em>JavaWorld</em> has created a regular column by
this author. We hope you enjoy this debut article of <strong>Java
Toolbox</strong>! <em>(3,800 words)</em>

In his recent "<a
href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-08-1998/jw-08-techniques.html">
Design for thread safety</a>" article (part of the <strong>Design
Techniques</strong> column), Bill Venners introduced the notion of a
<em>race condition,</em> a situation whereby two threads simultaneously
contend for the same object and, as a consequence, leave the object in
an undefined state. Bill pointed out that Java's
<code>synchronized</code> keyword is in the language to help avoid
these problems, and he provided a straightforward example of its use.
<a href="http://www.javaworld.com/jw-09-1998/jw-09-threads.html">Last month's
article</a> was the first in a series on threads. The present article
continues that series, covering race conditions in depth. It also
discusses various deadlock scenarios, which are related to race
conditions but are much harder to find and debug. This month, we'll
focus primarily on the problems encountered when programming Java
threads.  Subsequent <strong>Java Toolbox</strong> columns will focus
entirely on solutions.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Monitors, mutexes, and bathrooms</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Just to make sure we're all starting from the same place, a little
review of terms is in order. The central concept for synchronization in
the Java model is the <em>monitor,</em> developed some 20 years ago by
C.A.R.Hoare.  A monitor is a body of code guarded by a
mutual-exclusion semaphore (or, to use a term coined at Digital Equipment
Corp., a <em>mutex</em>).  The central notion of a mutex concerns
ownership. Only one thread can own the mutex at a time. If a second
thread tries to "acquire" ownership, it will block (be suspended) until
the owning thread "releases" the mutex.  If several threads are all
waiting to acquire the same mutex, they will all be released simultaneously 
when the owning thread releases the mutex.  The released
threads will then have to sort out amongst themselves who gains
ownership.  (Typically, priority order, FIFO order, or some combination
thereof is used to determine which thread gains control.) You <em>guard</em> a
block of code by acquiring a mutex at the top of the block and
releasing it at the bottom.  The code comprising the monitor does not
have to be contiguous:  several discontiguous code blocks can all
acquire and release the same mutex, in which case all of this code is considered
to be in the same monitor because it uses a common mutex.

<P>
The best analogy I've heard for a monitor is an airplane bathroom.
Only one person can be in the bathroom at a time (we hope). Everybody
else is queued up in a rather narrow aisle waiting to use it. As long
as the door is locked, the bathroom is unaccessible.  Given these terms,
in our analogy the object is the airplane, the bathroom is the monitor 
(assuming there's only one bathroom), and the lock on the door is the mutex.

<P>
In Java, every <em>object</em> has one and only one monitor and mutex
associated with it.  The single monitor has several doors into it,
however, each indicated by the <code>synchronized</code> keyword.  When
a thread passes over the <code>synchronized</code> keyword, it
effectively locks all the doors.  Of course, if a thread doesn't pass
across the <code>synchronized</code> keyword, it hasn't locked the
door, and some other thread is free barge in at any time.

<P>
Bear in mind that the monitor is associated with the <em>object,</em> not
the <em>class.</em> Several threads can all be executing the same method in
parallel, but the receiving objects (as identified by the <code>this</code>
references) have to be different. For example,
several instances of a thread-safe queue could
be in use by several threads. These threads could simultaneously enqueue
objects to different queues,
but they could not enqueue to the same queue at the same time.
Only one thread at a time can be in the monitor for a given queue.

<P>
To refine the earlier analogy, the airplane is still the object, but
the monitor is really all the bathrooms combined (each synchronized
chunk of code is a bathroom).  When a thread enters any bathroom, the
doors on all the bathrooms are locked.  Different instances of a class
are different airplanes, however, and if the bathroom doors in your
airplane are unlocked, you needn't really care about the state of the
doors in the other airplanes.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Why is stop() deprecated in JDK 1.2?</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The fact that the monitor is built into every Java object is actually
somewhat controversial. Some of the problems associated with
bundling the condition variable and mutex together inside every Java
object have been fixed in JDK 1.2, by the simple expediency of
deprecating the most problematic methods of the <code>Thread</code> class:
<code>stop()</code> and <code>suspend()</code>.  You can deadlock a
thread if you call either of these methods from inside a synchronized
method of your own.  Look at the following method, remembering that the
mutex is the lock on the door, and the thread that locks the door
"owns" the monitor.  That's why the <code>stop()</code> and
<code>suspend()</code> methods are deprecated in JDK 1.2.  Consider
this method:

<P>
<pre>
class some_class
{	//...

	synchronized void f()
	{	Thread.currentThread().stop();
	}
}
</pre>

<P>
Now consider what happens when a thread calls <code>f()</code>.  The
thread acquires the lock when entering the monitor but then stops.
<em>The mutex is not released by <code>stop()</code></em>.  This is the
equivalent of someone going into the bathroom, locking the door, and
flushing himself down the toilet!  Any other thread that now
tries to call <code>f()</code> (or any other synchronized method of the
class) on the same object is blocked forever. The
<code>suspend()</code> method (which is also deprecated) has the same
problem.  The <code>sleep()</code> method (which is <em>not</em>
deprecated) can be just as tricky. (Someone goes into the bathroom,
locks the door, and falls asleep).  Also remember that Java objects,
even those that extend <code>Thread</code> or implement
<code>Runnable</code>, continue to exist, even if the associated thread
has stopped.  You can indeed call a synchronized method on an object
associated with a stopped thread.  Be careful.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Race conditions and spin locks</STRONG></FONT><BR>
A <em>race condition</em> occurs when two threads try to access the
same object at the same time, and the behavior of the code changes
depending on who wins. The following diagram shows a single
(unsynchronized) object accessed simultaneously by multiple threads.  A
thread can be preempted in <code>fred()</code> after modifying one
field but before modifying the other. If another thread comes along at
that point and calls any of the methods shown, the object will be left
in an unstable state, because the initial thread will eventually wake
up and modify the other field.

<P>

Usually, you think of objects sending messages to other objects. In
multithreaded environments, you must think about message handlers
running on threads. Think: this thread causes this object to send
a message to that object. A race condition can occur when two threads
cause messages to be sent to the same object at the same time.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Working with <code>wait()</code> and <code>notify()</code></STRONG></FONT><BR>
The following code demonstrates a blocking queue used for one thread to
notify another when some event occurs. (We'll see a more realistic
version of these in a future article, but for now I want to keep things
simple.)  The basic notion is that a thread that tries to dequeue from
an empty queue will block until some other thread puts something in the
queue.

<P>
<pre>
class Notifying_queue 
{
    private static final queue_size = 10;
    private Object[]  queue = new Object[ queue_size ];
    private int       head  = 0;
    private int       tail  = 0;
    public void synchronized enqueue( Object item )
    {
        queue[++head %= queue_size ]= item; 
        this.notify();                  // The "this" is there only to
    }                                   // improve readability.
    public Object synchronized dequeue( )
    {
        try
        {	if( head == tail ) // <em><=== This is a bug</em>
	        	this.wait();
    	}
        catch( InterruptedException e )
        {
			// If we get here, we were not actually notified.
			// returning null doesn't indicate that the
			// queue is empty, only that the waiting was
			// abandoned.

        	return null;
    	}

        return queue[++tail %= queue_size ]; 
    }
}
</pre>

<P>
Starting with an empty queue, let's follow the sequence of operations
in play if one thread does a dequeue and then another (at some later
time) enqueues an item.

<P>
<ol>
<li>The dequeueing thread calls <code>dequeue()</code>, entering the
monitor (and locking out other threads) until the monitor is released.
The thread tests for an empty queue (<code>head==tail</code>) and then
calls <code>wait()</code>.  (I'll explain why this is a bug in a
moment.)

<P>
<li>The <code>wait()</code> releases the lock. (The current thread
<em>temporarily</em> leaves the monitor.) It then blocks on a second
synchronization object called a <em>condition variable.</em> (The basic notion
of a condition variable is that a thread blocks until some condition
becomes true. In the case of Java's built-in condition variable, the
thread will wait until the notified condition is set to true by
some other thread calling <code>notify</code>.) It's important to
realize that <STRONG><FONT COLOR="FF0909">the waiting thread has released the monitor
</FONT></STRONG> at this juncture.

<P>
<li>A second thread now comes along and enqueues an object, eventually
calling <code>notify()</code>, thereby releasing the waiting
(dequeueing) thread.

<P>
<li>The dequeueing thread now has to wait to reacquire the monitor
before <code>wait()</code> can return, so it blocks again, this time on
the lock associated with the monitor.

<P>
<li>The en queueing thread returns from the <code>enqueue()</code> method
releasing the monitor.

<P>
<li>The dequeueing thread acquires the monitor, <code>wait()</code>
returns, an object is dequeued, and <code>dequeue()</code> returns,
releasing the monitor.
</ol>

<P>
<strong>Race conditions following a wait()</strong><br>
Now, what sorts of problems can arise? The main ones are unexpected
race conditions.  First, what if you replaced the <code>notify()</code>
call with a call to <code>notifyAll()</code>?  Imagine that several
threads were simultaneously trying to dequeue something from the same,
empty, queue.  All of these threads are blocked on a single condition
variable, waiting for an enqueue operation to be executed.  When
<code>enqueue()</code> sets the condition to true by calling
<code>notifyAll()</code>, the threads are all released from the wait
(moved from a <em>suspended</em> to a <em>runnable</em> state).  The released threads
all try to acquire the monitor at once, but only one would "win" and
get the enqueued object. The problem is that the others would then get
the monitor too, in some undefined sequence, after the winning thread
had dequeued the object and returned from <code>dequeue()</code>.
Since these other threads don't retest for an empty queue, they will
dequeue garbage. (Looking at the code, the <code>dequeue()</code>
method will advance the tail pointer to the next slot, the contents of
which are undefined since the queue is empty.)

<P>
Fix the problem by replacing the <code>if</code> statement with a
<code>while</code> loop (called a <em>spin lock</em>). Now the threads that
don't get the object will go back to waiting:

<P>
<pre>
    public Object synchronized dequeue( )
    {
        try
        {	<em>while</em>( head == tail )	// used to be an if
	        	this.wait();
    	}
        catch( InterruptedException e )
        {	return null;
    	}

        return queue[++tail %= queue_size ]; 
    }
</pre>

<P>
That <code>while</code> loop also solves another, less obvious
problem.  What if we leave the <code>notify()</code> statement in
place, and don't put in a <code>notifyAll()</code>? Since
<code>notify()</code> releases only one waiting thread, won't that
solve the problem? It turns out that the answer is no. Here's what can
happen:

<P>
<ol>
<li><code>notify()</code> is called by the enqueueing thread, releasing
the condition variable.

<P>
<li>The dequeueing thread is then preempted, after being released from
the wait on the condition variable, but <em>before</em> it tries to
reacquire the monitor's lock.

<P>
<li>A second thread calls <code>dequeue()</code> at exactly this point,
<em>and successfully enters the monitor</em> because no other threads
are officially waiting. This second thread successfully dequeues the
object; <code>wait()</code> is never called since the queue isn't
empty.

<P>
<li>The original thread is now allowed to run, it acquires the monitor,
doesn't test for empty a second time, and then dequeues garbage.
</ol>

<P>
This second scenario is easily fixed the same way as the first: replace
the <code>if</code> statement with a <code>while</code> loop.

<P>
Note that the Java specification does not require that
<code>wait()</code> be implemented as an atomic operation (that is, one that
can't be preempted while moving from the condition variable to the
monitor's lock).  This means that using an <code>if</code> statement instead of a
<code>while</code> loop might work in some Java implementations, but the
behavior is really undefined.  Using a spin lock instead of a simple
<code>if</code> statement is cheap insurance against implementations
that don't treat <code>wait()</code> as atomic.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Threads are not objects</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Now let's move on to harder-to-find problems.  The first difficulty is
the commonplace confusion of threads and objects:  <em>Methods run
on threads, objects do not.</em> Put another way, the only way to
get a method to run on a given thread is to call it (either directly or
indirectly) from that thread's <code>run()</code> method. Simply
putting it into the <code>Thread</code> derivative is not enough.  For
example, look at the following simple thread (which just prints its
fields every so often):

<P>
<pre>
class My_thread extends Thread
{
	private int field_1 = 0;
	private int field_2 = 0;

	public void run()
	{	
		setDaemon(true);  // this thread will not keep the app alive

		while( true )
		{
			System.out.println( " field_1=" + field_1
									" field_2=" + field_2 );
			sleep(100);
		}
	}

	synchronized public void modify( int new_value )
	{	field_1 = new_value;
			field_2 = new_value;
	}
}
</pre>

<P>
You could start up the thread and send it a message like this:

<P>
<pre>
My_thread test = new My_thread;

test.start();
//...
test.modify(1);
</pre>

<P>
The only functions that run on the new thread are <code>run()</code>
itself and <code>println()</code> (which <code>run()</code> calls).
The <code>modify()</code> method <em>never</em> runs on the same thread
as the <code>println</code> call; rather, it runs on whatever thread
was running when the call was made. (In this case, it runs on whatever
thread <code>main()</code> is running on.) Depending on timing, the
earlier fragment could print:

<P>
<pre>
field_1=0, field2=0
</pre>

<P>
But it could just as easily print:

<P>
<pre>
field_1=0, field2=1
</pre>

<P>
or

<P>
<pre>
field_1=1, field2=1
</pre>

<P>
There's just no telling. (In the first and last cases, the thread would have
been outside the <code>println</code> statement when
<code>modify()</code> was called.  In the second example, the thread
would have been halfway through evaluating the arguments to
<code>println()</code>, having fetched <code>field_1</code>, but not
<code>field_2</code>. It prints the unmodified <code>field_1</code> and
the <em>modified</em> <code>field_2</code>.

<P>
The main issue here is that there is no simple solution to this problem.
The <code>modify()</code> method is indeed synchronized in the earlier
example, but <code>run()</code> can't be.  Were it synchronized, you'd
enter the monitor (and lock the object), when you started up the
thread.  Thereafter, any other thread that called any synchronized
method on the object (such as <code>modify()</code>) would block until 
the monitor was released.  Since <code>run()</code>
doesn't return (as is often the case), the release will never happen,
and the thread will act like a black hole, sucking up any other thread
that calls any of its synchronized methods.  In the current example,
the main thread would be suspended, and the program would hang.  So just
using the <code>synchronized</code> keyword in a naive way gets us
nowhere.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The deadlock scenario</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Synchronizing <code>run()</code> is a good example of a simple
<em>deadlock</em> scenario, where a thread is blocked forever, waiting
for something to happen that can't.  Let's look at a few examples that
are more realistic than this.

<P>
The most common deadlock scenario occurs when two threads are both
waiting for each other to do something. The following (admittedly
contrived) code snippet makes what's going on painfully obvious:

<P>
<pre>
class Flintstone
{
	int field_1;	private Object lock_1 = new int[1];
	int field_2;	private Object lock_2 = new int[1];

	public void fred( int value )
	{	synchronized( lock_1 )
		{	synchronized( lock_2 )
			{
				field_1 = 0;
				field_2 = 0;
			}
		}
	}

	public void barney( int value )
	{	synchronized( lock_2 )
		{	synchronized( lock_1 )
			{
				field_1 = 0;
				field_2 = 0;
			}
		}
	}
}
</pre>

<P>
Now, imagine a scenario whereby one thread (call it Wilma) calls
<code>fred()</code>, passes through the synchronization of
<code>lock_1</code>, and is then preempted, allowing another thread
(call it Betty) to execute.  Betty calls <code>barney()</code>,
acquires <code>lock_2</code>, and tries to acquire <code>lock_1</code>, but
can't because Wilma has it.  Betty is now blocked, waiting for
<code>lock_1</code> to become available, so Wilma wakes up and tries to
acquire <code>lock_2</code> but can't because Betty has it.  Wilma and
Betty are now deadlocked.  Neither one can ever execute.

<P>
(Note that <code>lock_1</code> and <code>lock_2</code> have to be
one-element arrays rather than simple <code>int</code>s, because only
objects have monitors in Java; the argument to
<code>synchronized</code> must be an object.  An array is a first-class
object in Java; a primitive-type such as <code>int</code> is not.
Consequently, you can synchronize on it.  Moreover, a one-element array
is efficient to bring into existence compared to a more elaborate
object (like an <code>Integer</code>) since it's both small and does
not require a constructor call.  Also, note that I can keep the
reference to the lock as a simple <code>Object</code> reference, since
I'll never access the array elements.)

<P>
As I mentioned above, Wilma and Betty are a contrived example, but the
multiple-lock situation comes up frequently. I'll give a more detailed
example next month.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Get out the magnifying glass</STRONG></FONT><BR>
If all deadlock scenarios were as easy to recognize as Wilma and Betty,
deadlock wouldn't be a problem. Consider the following code, though:

<P>
<pre>
class Boss
{
	private Side_kick robin;

	public synchronized void set_side_kick( Side_kick kid_in_tights )
	{	robin = kid_in_tights;
	};

	public synchronized void to_the_bat_cave()
	{	robin.get_in_the_car();	
	}

	public synchronized void okay()		// sent to us by robin
	{	//...
	}

	public synchronized void hold_on()	// sent to us by robin
	{	//...
	}
}
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
class Side_kick
{
	private Boss batman;

	public synchronized void set_boss( Boss guy_in_cape )
	{	batman = guy_in_cape;
	}

	public synchronized void get_in_the_car()	// sent by batman
	{	batman.okay();
	}

	public synchronized void sock_bam_pow()		// sent from outside
	{	batman.hold_on();
	}
}
//----------------------------------------------------------------------
class Gotham_city
{	static Boss		 batman	= new Boss();
	static Side_kick robin	= new Side_kick();

	public static void main( String[] args )
	{
		batman.set_side_kick( robin );
		robin.set_boss( batman );

		// spawn off a bunch of threads that use batman and robin.
	}
}
</pre>

<P>
Now imagine the following:

<P>
<ol>
<li>One thread (call it Alfred) issues a
<code>to_the_bat_cave()</code> request to the <code>batman</code>
object passed to it from <code>main()</code>.

<P>
<li>The <code>batman</code> object starts to process the method, but is
preempted just before it calls <code>robin.get_in_the_car()</code>.  At
this juncture, Alfred has acquired the lock for the <code>batman</code>
object.

<P>
<li>Now along comes a second thread (call it Joker), which issues a
<code>sock_bam_pow()</code> message to the <code>robin</code> object
that it got from <code>main()</code>.

<P>
<li>The <code>robin</code> object (whose <code>sock_bam_pow()</code>
method is running on the Joker thread) tries to send a
<code>hold_on()</code> message to <code>batman</code>, but can't
because Alfred owns the lock on <code>batman</code>. So the Joker
thread is now blocked, waiting for Alfred to release the lock on
<code>batman</code>.

<P>
<li>Now Alfred gets a chance to run, and it tries to send a
<code>get_in_the_car()</code> message to the <code>robin</code> object,
but it can't because the Joker thread owns the lock on
<code>robin</code>.  Both threads are now deadlocked (sound familiar?)
</ol>

<P>
<STRONG><FONT COLOR="FF0909">Remember: threads own the locks and methods
execute on threads, not objects.</FONT></STRONG>

<P>
This situation is, of course, much harder to see than the
Wilma-and-Betty problem because the locks in the
<code>batman</code>-<code>robin</code> example are the natural locks
associated with individual objects. There are no standalone
synchronized statements in the <code>batman</code>-<code>robin</code>
code, and the locks are associated with two completely distinct
objects.

<P>
Multithreaded programmers tear their hair out looking for the causes of
these sorts of problems, and there are only two solutions.  The first
is to thoroughly design the code before implementing it, and then to
really study both the design and the implementation before you even
think about running it the first time.  When I do multithreaded
programs, I spend much more time on code and design reviews than I
spend on coding.

<P>
The other solution is to use an architecture that tends to minimize
these sorts of problems. (Various threading architectures will be the
subject of the remaining articles in this series.)

<P>
There is no magic bullet there.  I've seen ads for a couple of products
that instrument a VM in a way that, in theory, will detect deadlock and
race conditions.  The problem, though, is a classic
Heisenberg-uncertainty dilemma: there's no way to observe the process
without impacting it.  If the problem is timing-related, adding a print
statement or changing to a debugging version of the VM will change the
timing, perhaps eliminating the problem.  I haven't actually used any
of these products yet, but I remain skeptical.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Nested-monitor lockout</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Another important form of deadlock is not discussed much in the
Java-language books: <em>nested-monitor lockout.</em> This problem
usually occurs when you call a blocking function from within a
synchronized method, and the only way to release the block is to call
another synchronized method. The following code demonstrates the
problem.

<P>
<pre>
class Notifying_queue 
{	// Same class as was described earlier, blocks on dequeue from
	// an empty queue.
	//...
}

class Black_hole
{
    private Notifying_queue queue = new Notifying_queue(5);

    public synchronized void put( Object thing )
    {	queue.enqueue( thing );
    }

    public synchronized Object get( )
    {	return queue.dequeue();
    }
}

</pre>

<P>
Consider what happens when you try to dequeue something from an empty
queue:

<P>
<ol>
<li>You call <code>get()</code> to get the item from the queue.

<P>
<li><code>get()</code> is synchronized, so the <code>Black_hole</code>
is now locked.

<P>
<li><code>get()</code> calls <code>dequeue()</code>, which blocks,
waiting for some other thread to enqueue something. <code>get()</code>
does not return.

<P>
<li>Another thread tries to enqueue something, but the only way to
enqueue something is by calling <code>put</code>, which we can't do
because the <code>Black_hole</code> is locked. That is, any thread that
tries to <code>put()</code> will block because the first thread has not
returned from <code>get()</code> yet.
</ol>

<P>
The <code>Black_hole</code> now sucks up all threads that try to
<code>put()</code> or <code>get()</code> anything.  They all block
forever.

<P>
Depending on where this occurs, the black hole could suck up every
thread in your program. Also bear in mind that this problem can occur
anytime you have a blocking call (such as a file read) inside a
synchronized method.

<P>
The only cures are:

<P>
<ol>
<li>Don't make blocking calls in synchronized methods

<P>
<li>Make sure there's a way to talk to the blocking object via another
class or a nonsynchronized method
</ol>

<P>
In the current situation, you could just not synchronize
<code>put()</code>, but that wouldn't work in a more realistic
situation where <code>put()</code> accessed fields of the class that
were accessed by other methods.

<P>
This problem has been known since Java 1.0 was in the early prerelease
stage, and several people complained vociferously about it.  (The
problem is a direct result of the way Java's synchronization works
-- the condition variable and mutex are both part of the object and not
separate entities --- compounded by the fact that you have to acquire
the mutex to wait on the condition.) But as Doug Lea pointed out in a
recent e-mail to me:

<P>
<blockquote><em>
[the complaints] boiled down to "you tend to like best what you are
most used to." Java makes some things that are painful in POSIX easy,
and vice-versa. In any case, it is pretty easy to simulate one set of
primitives with the other.
</em></blockquote>

<P>
That's life, I guess.

<P>
The next several articles in this series on threads will present a
solution to the problem that decouples the semaphores from the things
they guard, but that solution introduces a whole set of additional
problems.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Conclusion</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Hopefully, I've demonstrated by now that programming in a
multithreaded environment isn't as easy as the evangelist types would
have you believe.  Java provides platform-independent ways to use the
two essential synchronization mechanisms: exclusion semaphores and
condition variables.  It does it in an awkward way, however, that
doesn't help much when you're trying to do more than blink your logo in
a simple applet.  All is not lost, however.  Over the next few months,
I'll present a library of classes that solve many common
threading problems, including some of the ones I've just discussed.
Sometimes, I even think of it as fun, but maybe that's because I've been 
programming too long.

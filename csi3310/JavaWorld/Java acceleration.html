<STRONG>Summary</STRONG><BR>
There are two basic types of benchmarking: benchmarking to discover
relative speeds or bottlenecks; and benchmarking to understand
performance characteristics and thus where to expect bottlenecks. This
article provides benchmarks for the second purpose, and it measures and
interprets the cost of various common language operations on different
hardware platforms. This information can help you look for performance
bottlenecks and avoid accidentally building bottlenecks into your
applications. It also helps you avoid the sin of premature
optimization: if a simple, clean algorithm is expected to run fast
enough, wait to optimize until after the need is clear. <em>(3,200
words)</em>

<p><font size=-1><strong>Note:</strong> The <strong>Arrays</strong> section
of this article was updated 9/3/98 to correct some benchmark
numbers, which were flawed due to a bug in the benchmark code, which
produced inaccurate results. The significant updated portion appears
in bold below.</font>

As a Java programmer, knowing the performance characteristics of
different Java environments running on different operating systems is
crucial. Having this information at hand can prepare you for potential
bottlenecks, and it can save you from building bottlenecks into your
apps accidentally.  This article tests six different Java environments
-- some with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler, some without -- running on
four OS's and provides valuable benchmarks that can help you out with
your Java development efforts.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>The testing process</STRONG></FONT><BR>
To understand performance characteristics and therefore where to expect
bottlenecks, I ran benchmark tests on the following typical Java
language constructs:  method call, try/catch set-up, object creation,
array creation, and array accessing. I didn't run tests of network I/O, 
disk I/O, or AWT performance -- the focus was purely on Java language
performance.  The tests were designed to avoid paging to disk.

<P>
Most of the tests required no garbage collection, so general system
performance cannot be inferred by simply adding the results from the
various tests together.  I ran no general computation tests like "Tower
of Hanoi" or "Sieve of Erastothenes."  I omitted general computational
tests because they're dedicated to showing relative speeds on differing platforms, 
and rarely show <em>where</em> bottlenecks are.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Target systems and environments</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The benchmark tests I ran for this article were performed on a
range of hardware systems and Java environments. The Java environments

<P>
To compare the various systems, I converted the time it took to perform
the various operations into clock cycles.  Why? This conversion makes
it possible to compare machines running CPUs at different speeds.  In
general, comparing different CPUs to each other in such a crude way can
be dangerous, because the amount of work that can be done in a single clock
cycle can vary a lot from CPU to CPU.  The 80486, for example, averages
about 2 clock cycles per instruction, while the Pentium executes
closer to 1.  Fortunately, the PowerPC 604e, UltraSPARC, Pentium Pro,
and Pentium-II are roughly comparable.  While cache behavior could be
different between the various systems, this seems not to affect the
performance much.  All the tests ran without paging to disk.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Method calls</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The ability to write and call methods (or functions) is a critical tool for
building and maintaining large systems.  Methods allow programs to
be broken into smaller, more easily handled chunks. However, if method
calls slow down a running program, programmers will design systems with
bigger parts and fewer method calls.

<P>
Object-oriented programming increases the number of method calls when
compared to equivalent procedural programs because
it encourages more <em>data encapsulation</em> (among other things).  Compare these
two lines of code and notice the extra method call in the line showing
encapsulation:

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE>
<TR>
<TD><strong>Without encapsulation:</strong></TD><TD>int x = someObject.x;</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
<TD><strong>With encapsulation:</strong></TD><TD>int x = someObject.getX();</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
Encapsulation increases the number of method calls in a program, so it
is essential that those method calls execute quickly.  If method calls
don't execute quickly, programmers often attempt to speed up their
programs by avoiding encapsulating the data in their programs.
Examples of this lack of encapsulation can be seen in some of the
standard Java classes.  The class <code>java.awt.Dimension</code>, for
example, is written with both of its data members public.  A better
design would have hidden the data members by making them private and
providing public accessor methods:

<P>
<pre>
       private int height;
       private int width;

       public int getHeight()
       {
           return height;
       }

       public int getWidth()
       {
           return width;
       }

</pre>

<P>
Because the early Java environments shipped without JIT compilers,
method calls were much slower than current Java environments.  The
encapsulation shown above may have been unacceptably slow to run in those
early environments, with the result that the data is public.

<P>
Fortunately, today's JIT-enabled Java environments perform method calls
much faster than earlier non-JIT-enabled environments.  There is less
of a need to make speed-versus-encapsulation tradeoffs in these
environments.  With the best JIT, static methods returning nothing and
taking no arguments execute in 2 clock cycles. Non-static method
calls returning integer quantities execute in 7 clock cycles.
Non-static method calls returning floating-point numbers execute in
8 clock cycles.

<P>
By making these accessor methods <code>final</code>, you can expect to
reduce these times by one clock cycle.  When running in a Java
environment without a JIT, method calls take anywhere between 280 and
500 clock cycles. A good JIT can speed up method calls by a factor of
more than 100 -- so in target environments with a good JIT, you can
have both encapsulation and speed.  In environments without a JIT or
with a poor JIT, programmers must decide on a case-by-case basis
whether speed or encapsulation is more important.  A good JIT can make
this decision unnecessary.

<P>
The graph below shows the effect adding parameters has on the time
a method call takes under various JIT-enabled Java runtimes.  While the
time a method call takes to execute varies considerably from one
runtime to another, adding parameters to a method call frequently
increases the time required to execute the method call.  Often, adding
one parameter does not increase the time required to execute a method
call.  Only rarely does adding a parameter speed up a method call. Also
note that, regardless of the number of parameters, there is some
general overhead in setting up a method call.  Once a decision has been
made to call a method, adding a few parameters will have little impact
on the time it takes to make the call.

Notice that the JIT for Netscape Navigator on the Macintosh runs 25 
percent as fast as the JITs on Windows.  I have no numbers for JIT-enabled 
runtimes on Solaris.  If you expect to support Macintosh and Windows clients, 
be sure to do your performance benchmarking on Macintoshes as well as on
Windows clients.

<P>
Several popular environments do not yet come with a JIT.  The graph
below shows the effects of adding parameters to the time a method call
takes under two non-JIT-enabled Java runtimes.  You'll see that the
cost of adding parameters is still mostly monotonic but that the
general overhead of setting up a function call is very high.

Java seems to be only about 1 clock cycle slower than C++.

<P>
<strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
If you expect to run with a reasonable JIT, method calls are no more
expensive in Java than they are in C or C++.  If you expect to run on a
system without a JIT or without a very good one, this is something
you'll have to pay attention to in the speed-critical portions of your
application.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Object creation</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Modern microprocessors run at speeds of up to 600 MHz. Unfortunately,
modern DRAM runs considerably slower.  In burst mode, a modern SDRAM
runs at about 100 MHz.  If programs accessed memory in a truly random
fashion, CPUs would spend most of their time waiting for DRAM.
Fortunately, programs don't access memory in a random fashion.  If a
memory location has been accessed recently, it is quite likely to be
accessed again soon.  This property is called <em>locality of
reference.</em>

<P>
Unfortunately, the locality of reference for Java programs can be worse
than it is in equivalent C or C++ programs.  This is due to object
creation. Object creation in a Java program is fundamentally different
than that in an equivalent C or C++ program.  Many of the small
temporary objects that C or C++ would create on the stack are created
on the heap in Java.

<P>
In C and C++, when these objects are discarded at the end of a method
call, the space is available for more temporary objects, and the stack
area is almost always in the on-board Level 1 cache.

<P>
In Java, the objects are discarded, but the space typically is not
reclaimed until the next garbage collection -- which usually doesn't
happen until the heap memory is exhausted.  The space for the
<em>next</em> temporary object in a Java program always comes off the
heap. The space for the new temporary object is rarely in a cache, and
so the initial use of the temporary object should run slower than the
initial use of a temporary object in a C or C++ program.

<P>
With the current Java runtimes, performance is also affected because
creating a new object is roughly as costly as a <code>malloc</code> in
C or a <code>new</code> operation in C++.  Creating a new object in any
of these ways takes hundreds or even thousands of clock cycles.  In C
and C++, creating an object on the stack takes about 20 clock cycles.
C and C++ programs create many temporary objects on the stack, but Java
programs don't have this option.

<P>
The graph below shows the cost of creating objects of various sizes
under different JIT-enabled Java runtimes.  The fastest time is 1.2
microseconds running under Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE) 4.0 on a 200-MHz
Pentium Pro. The time would likely be cut to about 0.6 microseconds on 
a 400-MHz Pentium-II.

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="5" BORDER="0"><TR><TD>

<IMG VSPACE="3" WIDTH="424" HEIGHT="386" SRC="ObjectCreationTime.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><STRONG>
</STRONG></FONT></CENTER>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>
Netscape Navigator on Macintosh, IE on Windows NT, and Symantec on Windows NT 
all show reasonable profiles: the time required to create an object
increases as the object size increases.

<P>
Navigator on Windows, however, shows very different behavior.  The time
it takes to create objects of different sizes cycles up and down.
Objects containing 4 integers ("ints") and objects containing 12 ints
are created fastest.  A similar profile appears under Navigator for
Solaris as well.  I have no explanation for this profile, but there is
a solution. When running applets under Navigator, padding object sizes
should result in a faster-running applet if object creation proves to
be a performance bottleneck.

<P>
The graph below shows object-creation times for objects of different
sizes when running under non-JIT-enabled systems.

<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE CELLPADDING="5" BORDER="0"><TR><TD>
<CENTER>
<IMG VSPACE="3" WIDTH="431" HEIGHT="362" SRC="ObjectCreationTime2.gif">
<BR><FONT SIZE="-1"><STRONG>
</STRONG></FONT></CENTER>
</TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>
One important thing to notice is that a JIT does not speed up object
creation time nearly as much as it speeds up method calls.  The
bottlenecks for the same program running under a JIT-enabled
environment and running under a non-JIT-enabled environment might well
be different -- if only subtly -- because of this.  While profiling a
Java application, you should bear in mind whether or not the profiler
has performance characteristics similar to the expected runtime
environment or environments.

<P>
Finally, the following graph shows the Java object-creation time in the
best environment, compared to C/C++ object creation on the stack.  The
speed difference is about 10 to 12 times.  Certain shortcuts can speed
up C/C++ object creation on the stack slightly more than these
already-fast times, but the shortcuts can reduce the maintainability of
the C/C++ code. Java doesn't give you the option of taking these
shortcuts.

<P>

</TD></TR></TABLE>
</CENTER>
<strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
In all Java runtime environments, object creation can become a
performance bottleneck.  Here JITs don't help very much!  Object
creation is something you must pay attention to for all Java programs.
This doesn't mean you should avoid object creation at all cost --
simply be aware of where you are creating lots of objects, and watch
for bottlenecks there.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Synchronization</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Correct, nontrivial, multithreaded environments require some degree of
synchronization.  The chart below shows the times required for various

<P>
Several things are worth noting:

<P>
First, synchronizing on an already-acquired monitor is usually, but not
always, cheaper than acquiring and releasing the monitor.

<P>
Second, the time required for the same operation when executed by
different Java runtimes can vary by a ratio of almost 40 to 1! The
bottlenecks on various systems may well be different if there is a
significant amount of synchronization.  Profiling for performance
bottlenecks should, if at all possible, be achieved on a runtime 
similar to the target runtime.

<P>
Third, on some systems the cost of synchronizing a class is
significantly higher than the cost of synchronizing an object.  This
suggests using a single global object instead of static class methods.

<P>
Fourth, the overhead of synchronization makes the cost of calling a
synchronized method significantly more expensive than calling a
nonsynchronized method.  This can make synchronization prohibitive for
accessor functions. A nonsynchronized accessor that takes 7 to 10 clock
cycles could take 500 clock cycles if it is synchronized.  This does
not suggest writing thread-unsafe code, but does suggest that designing
the program to require little or no synchronization might be a good
strategy for speed-critical portions of the program.

<P>
<strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
With a good Java runtime environment, synchronizing is more expensive
than method calls but much less expensive than object creation.  In
this case, the only thing to worry about is synchronization operations
in tight inner loops.  When running in a poor Java runtime,
synchronization can become more of a bottleneck in general.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Exception overhead</STRONG></FONT><BR>
Since exceptions are the chosen mechanism for handling errors in Java,
it makes sense to ask how expensive setting up a <code>try/catch</code>
block is.  The answer is:  0 to 3 clock cycles on JIT-enabled systems,
and 30 to 40 on non-JIT-enabled systems.  The runtime cost of
<code>try/catch</code> blocks is close to zero.  If
<code>try/catch</code> blocks don't appear inside speed-critical inner
loops, they should have no impact on application performance.

<P>
The primary alternative to exceptions is to use status-return codes.
Because using exceptions reduces the number of parameters needed in
method calls, using exceptions in Java programs can actually speed up
the program when compared to an equivalent program using status codes.

<P>
The cost of throwing an exception is higher than the cost of setting up
a <code>try/catch</code> block.  Since exception handling shouldn't be
done on a speed-critical path, this doesn't bother me and I haven't
benchmarked it.

<P>
<strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
The use of exceptions to handle error conditions in a Java program should
run the non-error case faster than using status return codes!  Setting
up <code>try/catch</code> blocks is fast.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Arrays <EM><font size=-1>(updated 9/3/98)</font></EM></STRONG></FONT><BR>
Java, unlike C and C++, implements arrays as true objects with
defined behavior, including range checking. This language difference
imposes overhead on a Java application using arrays that is missing
in equivalent C and C++ programs. Creating an array is object
creation. Further, using an array involves the overhead of checking
the array object for null and then range-checking the array index. C
and C++ omit the checks for null and the range checks, and thus
should run faster.

<P>
<strong>
The benchmark program measures the cost of accessing array elements for
various sized arrays.  Unfortunately, a bug in the benchmark program
reports the results for short arrays incorrectly, so only the results
for the largest array size should be considered valid. (The bug also affects
the other results, but only a few percentage points at most, and this is
as accurate as I expect for tests as simple as these).  Because I
don't have easy access to the most of the systems on which the test were
run, I can't rerun the tests with the bug fixed.

<P>
This table shows the cost of accessing each array element for 
the largest array size, which is relatively uneffected by the error.

The times in clock cycles are:

<P>
In general, array access is 2 or 3 times as expensive as accessing
non-array elements, even for large arrays when the range checking can
be amortized over many accesses.  Only the Symantec JIT compiler is
successful in optimizing most of this overhead, and this may occur only 
in the case of large arrays.

<P>
Array access for non-JIT-enabled environments is about one-tenth 
as fast as JIT-enabled environments.

<P>
Finally, because Java doesn't have arrays of objects but only arrays
of object references, the relative cost of creating a Java array of
objects compared to a C or C++ array of objects goes up as the array
gets longer.

<P>
<strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
Array access is slower than accessing atomic variables.  If you expect
to access a few elements in an array many times each, copying them to
atomic variables can speed things up.

<P>
<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Casting</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The Java programming language does not have templates. Because of this,
Java collection classes -- queues, stacks, dictionaries, and so on --
typically store references to type <code>java.lang.Object</code>.
Before using a reference retrieved from a collection class, the
reference must be converted from a reference to a
<code>java.lang.Object</code> into a reference to the underlying
object's type.  Converting a reference to a Java object from one type
to another is called <em>casting.</em>  Casting from a type at the top
of an inheritance hierarchy (<code>java.lang.Object</code> is at the
very top) to a type further down the inheritance hierarchy is called
<em>downcasting.</em>  Casting is more necessary in Java programs than
in equivalent C++ programs, and therefore the speed of casting is more
important, too.

<P>
Another major use of casting is for accessing interfaces. Using
interfaces in function signatures makes for more flexible program
architectures, but applications using interfaces generally run slightly
slower than applications using classes in function signatures.

<P>
The times for various cast operations are shown below.

<P>
Symantec has the best cast performance and has reduced the cost of
casts to almost nothing. The Macintosh executes casts especially
slowly. Finally, for most environments, casting an object reference to
the <em>last</em> declared interface is faster than casting to the
first declared interface. Declaring the most commonly used interface
last will speed things up marginally with little or no loss of program
clarity.

<P>
<strong>Recommendations</strong><br>
With a good Java runtime, casting runs very fast.  If you expect to run
in an environment with a good Java runtime, you can use interfaces with
almost no performance penalty.  You can also use collection classes
with almost no performance penalty.

<FONT SIZE="+1"><STRONG>Conclusions</STRONG></FONT><BR>
The results of the benchmarking tests discussed above do not lead to
any grand, unifying conclusion.  But it is instructive to list a number
of unrelated conclusions.

<P>
<UL>
<LI>Object creation time is quite a bit more expensive in Java than it
is in C or C++. With a good JIT and runtime, it is 10 to 12 times as
expensive; with a poor runtime, it is about 25 times as expensive.
JITs improve this situation, but not nearly as much as  they improve
things like method-call speed.  For performance in Java programming,
the most important thing to pay attention to -- but not panic over --
usually is the amount of object creation. Netscape Navigator has very 
strange object-creation behavior on some platforms.

<P>
<LI><code>try/catch</code> blocks are cheap -- a lot cheaper than I
expected.

<P>
<LI>Declaring the most commonly-used interface for a class last will
result in a small speed increase. Symantec, which
doesn't care, and Navigator under the Macintosh, which is already very
slow anyway, are exceptions to this rule.

<P>
<LI>With a JIT, method calls are about as fast in Java as in C or C++.

<P>
<LI>Synchronization is several times more expensive than a method call,
but still not as expensive as object creation.  The cost of
synchronization varies a lot between the various Java runtimes.

<P>
<LI>Array access is 2 or 3 times as expensive as member variable
access.  A good JIT can almost eliminate this overhead for large
arrays.

<P>
<LI>The <em>relative</em> speed of different activities varies a lot
from platform to platform and between JIT-enabled and non-JIT-enabled
systems.  To find the bottlenecks in your program you must profile your
application on a system with performance characteristics similar to the
systems on which you expect your application to run.  The bottlenecks
when running on a Macintosh may differ from the bottlenecks when
running on Linux.

<LI>There isn't much information about HotSpot available (as of mid-July 1998), but one Web page with some data claims "Short lived object benchmark: 18 secs classic VM, 8 sec's on Jview, 6 secs malloc/free C, 2 secs HotSpot". If these numbers are representative, we should expect to see object creation time drop to about 3 times greater than C/C++ stack allocation, down from 10 to 12 times greater. <BR>

<LI>An interesting theoretical paper on object creation is "Garbage collection can be faster than stack allocation" by Andrew Appel.  The paper is about object creation in Lisp, not Java, but still is relevant.  It provides some ammunition for the position that in theory, Java object allocation on the heap can be faster than C/C++ object creation on the stack.<BR>

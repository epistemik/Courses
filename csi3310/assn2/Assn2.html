<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT size=+2>THE DRAWING CONTEST</FONT></B><FONT size=+1>
  <P>We have a drawing contest with 5 finalists. Each artist is allowed to
  produce as many drawings as she wants during the contest. The author of the 
  best drawing wins the prize. It turns out that the jury consists of computer 
  science and computer engineering professors who know nothing about art. So the 
  jury has decided privately to simply pick the winning drawing at random as 
  long as the drawing contains at least one line of each available color in the 
  contest (red, blue, yellow, and green). But there was a leak, and the artists 
  have learned about this. So in order to maximize their chances of winning the 
  prize, the finalists have decided to produce simply as many drawings as they 
  could where each drawing would contain one line of each color above. 
  <P>To make a drawing, each artist must first grab a sheet of paper (there is a 
  pile of them, initially of 100 sheets) and then 4 pencils, one for each color. 
  No artist is allowed to hold more than 4 pencils at once, but at some point 
  she must hold one pencil of each color to produce a drawing which has a chance 
  to win. When an artist makes a drawing indicate that fact by writing on the 
  screen "Artist X makes a drawing". There are only 3 pencils of each color. 
  Whenever an artist has finished her drawing she must release her 4 pencils
  then hand the drawing (with her signature on it) to the jury (on a designated 
  pile) and get a new sheet of paper.&nbsp; Returning the drawing to the jury 
  and placing it into the designated pile takes a little amount of time which 
  you should simulate by a random sleeping time interval between 1 and 8 
  milliseconds. For the pile, use a buffer of 100 integers: each time an artists 
  hands a drawing, place the artist identification number into the buffer at the 
  next available position. When an artist has handed a drawing indicate that 
  fact by writing on the screen "Artist X has handed drawing #Y" (where the 
  drawing # is just the position in the buffer of where that drawing has been 
  placed). Getting a new sheet of paper takes also a small amount of time, which 
  you should simulate by a random sleeping time interval between 1 and 8 
  milliseconds. After obtaining a sheet of paper, an artist must get 4 pencils, 
  one of each color. In the process of getting the pencils, as soon as she finds 
  a color that she does not have, she grabs it but she may need to wait until 
  other artists make the necessary colors available. When there are no more
  sheets of paper available, a jury thread starts to select the winner by 
  choosing at random an entry into the buffer. Your solution must be equally 
  fair to all the artists and must be free of deadlocks. 
  <P>In this assignment you must use semaphores (and <B>only</B> semaphores) to 
  achieve thread synchronization and mutual exclusion when needed. Of course, 
  this means that you must construct the semaphores with Java's synchronized 
  methods. You must not use monitors because in the next assignment you will be 
  asked to use monitors... 
  <P>For any questions you might have, please ask your TAs first :-) 
  <P>Here is a sample of execution (that was obtained from my program):</FONT>
  <P>Artist 0 makes a drawing <BR>Artist 1 makes a drawing <BR>Artist 2 makes a 
  drawing <BR>Artist 3 makes a drawing <BR>Artist 4 makes a drawing <BR>Artist 0 
  has handed drawing #0 <BR>Artist 1 has handed drawing #1 <BR>Artist 4 has

<h2>
Controlling Access to Members of a Class
</h2>
<blockquote>

One of the benefits of classes is that classes can protect
their member variables and methods from access by other objects. Why
is this important? Well, consider this. You're writing a class
that represents a query on a database that contains all kinds of
secret information, say employee records or income statements for
your startup company.
<p>
Certain information and queries contained in the class, the ones
supported by the publicly accessible methods and variables in your
query object, are OK for the consumption of any other object in the
system. Other queries contained in the class are there simply for
the personal use of the class. They support the operation of the class
but should not be used by objects of another type--you've got secret
information to protect. You'd like to be able to protect these personal
variables and methods at the language level and disallow access by
objects of another type.
<p>
In Java, you can use access specifiers to protect both a class's
variables and its methods when you declare them.
The Java language supports four distinct access levels for
member variables and methods: private, protected, public, and,
if left unspecified, package.
<p>
<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The 1.0 release of the Java language
supported five access levels: the four listed above plus
<code>private protected</code>. The <code>private protected</code>
access level is not supported in versions of Java higher than 1.0;
you should no longer be using it in your Java programs.
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
The following chart shows the access level permitted by each specifier.
<p>

<table border cellpadding=5>
<th>Specifier</th>
<th>class</th>
<th>subclass</th>
<th>package</th>
<th>world</th>
<tr><td><code>private</code></td><td align=center>X</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td>
<tr><td><code>protected</code></td><td align=center>X</td><td align=center>X*</td><td align=center>X</td><td>&nbsp;</td>

</table>


<p>


The first column indicates whether the class itself has access
to the member defined by the access specifier. As you can see, a class
always has access to its own members. The second
column indicates whether subclasses of the class (regardless of
which package they are in) have access to the member. The
third column indicates whether classes in the same package as the
class (regardless of their parentage) have access to the
member. The fourth column indicates whether all classes have
access to the member.
<p>
Note that the protected/subclass intersection
has an '*' .  This particular access case
has a special caveat discussed in detail
<a href=#protectedcaveat>later</a>.
<p>
Let's look at each access level in more detail.

</blockquote>
<h3>Private</h3>
<blockquote>
The most restrictive access level is private.
A private member is accessible only to the class in which it is defined.
Use this access to declare members that should only be used by the class.
This includes variables that contain information that if accessed by
an outsider could put the object in an inconsistent state, or methods
that, if invoked by an outsider, could jeopardize the state of the object
or the program in which it's running. Private members are like secrets
you never tell anybody.

<p>
To declare a private member, use the <code>private</code> keyword
in its declaration. The following class contains one private member
variable and one private method:
<blockquote><pre>
class Alpha {
    private int iamprivate;
    private void privateMethod() {
        System.out.println("privateMethod");
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
Objects of type <code>Alpha</code> can inspect or modify the <code>iamprivate</code>
variable and can invoke <code>privateMethod</code>, but objects
of other types cannot. For example, the <code>Beta</code> class defined here:
<blockquote><pre>
class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprivate = 10;      // illegal
        a.privateMethod();      // illegal
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
cannot access the <code>iamprivate</code> variable or invoke
<code>privateMethod</code> on an object of type <code>Alpha</code> because
<code>Beta</code> is not of type <code>Alpha</code>.
<p>
When one of your classes is attempting to access a member varible
to which it does not have access, the compiler prints an error message similar
to the following and refuses to compile your program:
<blockquote><pre>
Beta.java:9: Variable iamprivate in class Alpha not 
accessible from class Beta.
        a.iamprivate = 10;     // illegal
         ^
1 error
</pre></blockquote>
Also, if your program is attempting to access a method to which it does
not have access, you will see a compiler error like this:
<blockquote><pre>
Beta.java:12: No method matching privateMethod()
found in class Alpha.
        a.privateMethod();         // illegal
1 error
</pre></blockquote>
New Java programmers might ask if one <code>Alpha</code> object can access the private
members of another <code>Alpha</code> object. This is illustrated by the following example.
Suppose the <code>Alpha</code> class contained an instance method that compared the current
<code>Alpha</code> object (<code>this</code>) to another object based on their
<code>iamprivate</code> variables:
<blockquote><pre>
class Alpha {
    private int iamprivate;
    boolean isEqualTo(Alpha anotherAlpha) {
        if (this.iamprivate == anotherAlpha.iamprivate)
            return true;
        else
            return false;
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
This is perfectly legal. Objects of the same type have access to one another's
private members. This is because access restrictions apply at the class or type
level (all instances of a class) rather than at the object level (this particular
instance of a class).
<p>
<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;<code>this</code> is a Java language keyword that
refers to the current object. For more information about how to use
<code>this</code> see <a href="methodbody.html">The Method Body</a>.
<hr></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h3>Protected</h3>
<blockquote>
The next access level specifier is protected, which allows the class itself,
subclasses (with the caveat that we referred to earlier), and all classes
in the same package to access the members. Use the protected access level
when it's appropriate for a class's subclasses to have access to the member,
but not unrelated classes. Protected members are like family secrets--you
don't mind if the whole family knows, and even a few trusted friends but you
wouldn't want any outsiders to know.
<p>
To declare a protected member, use the keyword <code>protected</code>.
First, let's look at how the protected specifier affects access for classes
in the same package.
Consider this version of the <code>Alpha</code> class which
is now declared to be within a package named <code>Greek</code>
and which has one protected member variable and one
protected method declared in it:
<blockquote><pre>
package Greek;

public class Alpha {
    protected int iamprotected;
    protected void protectedMethod() {
        System.out.println("protectedMethod");
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
Now, suppose that the class <code>Gamma</code> was also declared to be a member of
the <code>Greek</code> package (and is not a subclass of <code>Alpha</code>). 
The <code>Gamma</code> class
can legally access an <code>Alpha</code> object's <code>iamprotected</code> member
variable and can legally invoke its <code>protectedMethod</code>:
<blockquote><pre>
package Greek;

class Gamma {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iamprotected = 10;    // legal
        a.protectedMethod();    // legal
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
<a name=protectedcaveat>
That's pretty straightforward.</a> Now, let's investigate how the <code>protected</code>
specifier affects access for subclasses of <code>Alpha</code>.
<p>
Let's introduce a new class, <code>Delta</code>, that
derives from <code>Alpha</code> but lives in a different package--<code>Latin</code>. The <code>Delta</code> class can
access both <code>iamprotected</code> and <code>protectedMethod</code>,
but only on objects of type <code>Delta</code> or its subclasses. The <code>Delta</code>
class cannot
access <code>iamprotected</code> or <code>protectedMethod</code> on objects
of type <code>Alpha</code>. <code>accessMethod</code> in the following code sample
attempts to access the <code>iamprotected</code> member variable on an object
of type <code>Alpha</code>, which is illegal, and on an object of type <code>Delta</code>, which is legal.
Similarly, <code>accessMethod</code> attempts to invoke an
<code>Alpha</code> object's <code>protectedMethod</code> which is also illegal:
<blockquote><pre>
package Latin;

import Greek.*;

class Delta extends Alpha {
    void accessMethod(Alpha a, Delta d) {
        a.iamprotected = 10;    // illegal
        d.iamprotected = 10;    // legal
        a.protectedMethod();    // illegal
        d.protectedMethod();    // legal
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
If a class is both a subclass of and in the same package as the class
with the protected member, then the class has access to the protected
member.
</blockquote>

<h3>Public</h3>
<blockquote>
The easiest access specifier is <code>public</code>. Any class, in any package,
has access to a class's public members. Declare public members
only if such access cannot produce undesirable results if an
outsider uses them. There are no personal or family secrets here;
this is for stuff you don't mind anybody else knowing.
<p>
To declare a public member,
use the keyword <code>public</code>. For example,
<blockquote><pre>
package Greek;

public class Alpha {
    public int iampublic;
    public void publicMethod() {
        System.out.println("publicMethod");
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
Let's rewrite our <code>Beta</code> class one more time and put it in a different package
than <code>Alpha</code> and make sure that it is completely unrelated to (not a subclass of)
<code>Alpha</code>:
<blockquote><pre>
package Roman;

import Greek.*;

class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iampublic = 10;       // legal
        a.publicMethod();       // legal
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
As you can see from the above code snippet, <code>Beta</code> can legally inspect
and modify the <code>iampublic</code> variable in the <code>Alpha</code> class and
can legally invoke <code>publicMethod</code>.
</blockquote>

<h3>Package</h3>
<blockquote>
The package access level is what you get if you don't
explicitly set a member's access to one of the other levels. This
access level allows classes in the same package as your class to
access the members. This level of access assumes that classes in
the same package are trusted friends. This level of trust is like
that which you extend to your closest friends but wouldn't trust
even to your family.
<p>
For example, this version of the <code>Alpha</code> class declares a single
package-access member variable and a single package-access method.
<code>Alpha</code> lives in the <code>Greek</code> package:
<blockquote><pre>
package Greek;

class Alpha {
    int iampackage;
    void packageMethod() {
        System.out.println("packageMethod");
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
The <code>Alpha</code> class has access both to <code>iampackage</code>
and <code>packageMethod</code>. In
addition, all the classes declared within the same package as
Alpha also have access to <code>iampackage</code> and
<code>packageMethod</code>.
Suppose that both <code>Alpha</code> and <code>Beta</code> were declared
as part of the <code>Greek</code> package:
<blockquote><pre>
package Greek;

class Beta {
    void accessMethod() {
        Alpha a = new Alpha();
        a.iampackage = 10;     // legal
        a.packageMethod();     // legal
    }
}
</pre></blockquote>
<code>Beta</code> can legally access <code>iampackage</code> and
<code>packageMethod</code> as shown.
</blockquote>

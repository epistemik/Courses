<P>
Semaphores are like goto's and pointers: mistake prone, work okay but
lack structure and ``discipline''.
</P>

<P>
For example, a disastrous typo:
<P>
<OL>
V(S); criticalSection(); V(S)
</OL>
</P>

<P>
This leads to deadlock:
<P>
<OL>
P(S); criticalSection(); P(S)
</OL>
</P>

<P>
Nested critical sections can lead to deadlock:
<P>
<OL>
P1: P(Q); P(S); ... V(S); V(Q);
<P>
P2: P(S); P(Q); ... V(Q); V(S);

A <I>monitor</I> is an object with some built-in mutual exclusion and
thread synchronization capabilities.
They are an integral part of the programming language so the compiler can
generate the correct code to implement the monitor.
Only one thread can be active at a time in the monitor,
where ``active'' means executing a method of the monitor.
Monitors also have <I>condition variables</I>,
on which a thread can <I>wait</I> if conditions are not right for it
to continue executing in the monitor.
Some other thread can then get in the monitor and perhaps change the
state of the monitor.
If conditions are now right, that thread can <I>signal</I> a waiting
thread, moving the latter to the ready queue to get back into the monitor
when it becomes free.
<P>

<P>
Monitors can use either <I>signal-and-exit</I> or <I>signal-and-continue</I>
signaling discipline.
In the former, a signaling thread must leave the monitor immediately,
at which point it is guaranteed that the signaled thread is the next one
in the monitor.
In the latter, the signaled thread is not guaranteed to be the next
one in the monitor.
In fact, <I>barging</I> can take place:
some thread that has called a monitor method and is blocked until the
monitor is free can get into the monitor before a signaled thread.
</P>

<P>
Here are monitors for the three ``classical'' problems using the
signal-and-exit signaling discipline and condition variables.
They are written in a Java-like <B>but not Java</B> pseudocode.
The <TT>synchronized</TT> attribute in a method definition means
that only one thread at a time can be active in any <TT>synchronized</TT>
method.

Philosopher starvation is prevented by introducing a new state: very hungry.
A philosopher is put into this state if it is hungry, if one of its
neighbors puts down its forks, and if it cannot eat because the
other fork is in use.
A new rule is added: a hungry philosopher cannot eat if it has
a very hungry neighbor.
These changes prevent a collaboration of two philosophers
trying to starve the philosopher between them.
Notice that signal-and-exit requires leaving and reentering
the monitor to generate more than one signal.

Writer starvation is prevented by requiring readers that come along to read
the database to wait if there is a waiting writer even if other readers
are currently reading the database.
When the current readers finish, the waiting writer writes the database
and then signals into the database a waiting reader.
Each entering reader signals another waiting reader into the database.

<P>
Java uses the <TT>synchronized</TT> keyword to indicate that only
one thread at a time can be executing in this or any other
<TT>synchronized</TT> method of the object representing the monitor.
A thread can call <TT>wait()</TT> to block and leave the monitor until
a <TT>notify()</TT> or <TT>notifyAll()</TT> places the thread back
in the ready queue to resume execution inside the monitor when scheduled.
A thread that has been sent a signal is <B>not</B> guaranteed to be
the next thread executing inside the monitor
compared to one that is blocked on a call to one of the monitor's
<TT>synchronized</TT> methods.
Also, it is <B>not</B> guaranteed that the thread that has been waiting
the longest is the one woken up with a <TT>notify()</TT>;
an arbitrary thead is chosen by the JVM.
Finally, when a <TT>notifyAll()</TT> is called to move all waiting threads
back into the ready queue, the first thread to get back into the
monitor is <B>not</B> necessarily the one that has been waiting the
longest.
</P>

<P>
Each Java monitor has a single nameless anonymous condition variable
on which a thread can <TT>wait()</TT> or signal one waiting thread
with <TT>notify()</TT> or signal all waiting threads with
<TT>notifyAll()</TT>.
This nameless condition variable corresponds to a lock on the object
that must be obtained whenever a thread calls a <TT>synchronized</TT>
method in the object.
Only inside a <TT>synchronized</TT> method may <TT>wait()</TT>,
<TT>notify()</TT>, and <TT>notifyAll()</TT> be called.
</P>

<P>
Methods that are <TT>static</TT> can also be <TT>synchronized</TT>.
There is a lock associated with the class that must be obtained
when a <TT>static</TT> <TT>synchronized</TT> method is called.
</P>

<P>
Usually all the publicly accessible methods, the service or access methods,
are <TT>synchronized</TT>.
But a Java monitor may be designed with some methods <TT>synchronized</TT>
and some not.
The non-<TT>synchronized</TT> methods may form the <TT>public</TT>
access and call the <TT>synchronized</TT> methods,
which are <TT>private</TT>.
</P>

<P>
An experiment was performed to determine if Java monitors are signal-and-exit
or signal-and-continue.
They use signal-and-continue.
When a thread executes a <TT>notify()</TT>,
Java does not necessarily move to the ready queue the thread that has
been waiting the longest.
Also, Java allows barging.
<P>
<OL>
<A HREF="Monitors/sigd.java">Java Monitors Use Signal-and-Continue.</A>

<P>
Here are Java monitors for the three ``classical'' problems.
Two important things to be aware of because of signal-and-continue,
the lack of named condition variables, and barging.
Most of the time it is necessary to use a <TT>while</TT> loop
instead of an <TT>if</TT> when doing a <TT>wait()</TT>.
<OL>
<PRE>
while (condition) try {wait();} catch (InterruptedException e) {}
</PRE>
</OL>
It is possible that some other thread barged in and got the resource
or whatever, requiring a recheck of the waiting condition.
Most of the time it is necessary to use <TT>notifyAll()</TT>
instead of <TT>notify()</TT> in order to awaken all waiting threads
and let them recheck their waiting condition.
It is not possible to direct a signal to the particular thread for whom
the resource is now available or whatever.

The bounded buffer monitor can only be used by a single producer thread
and a single consumer thread.
The ``driver'' code is the same as that for the semaphore single-producer
single-consumer bounded buffer.
What could go wrong if more than one thread of each type used this monitor?
How would you fix the monitor?

Notice how inefficient the dining philosophers monitor is because
a broadcast signal with <TT>notifyAll()</TT> must be sent whenever
any philosopher puts down its forks due to Java's lack of named condition
variables.

Since there are no named condition variables, another technique must
be used to prevent starvation in the database readers and writers.
The arrival times of readers forced to wait because of a
waiting writer is maintained.
When the waiting writer enters and then exits the database,
all waiting readers that arrived <B>before</B> the time the writer just
exiting finished writing are allowed to read the database.

A <I>notification</I> technique
can be used to avoid waking up all the philosopher threads
with a <TT>notifyAll()</TT>.
An array of notification objects, <TT>convey</TT>, is used,
one for each philosopher.
If the forks are not available when the philosopher gets hungry,
it waits inside its notification object for a <TT>notify()</TT>.

In contrast to named condition variables,
it is not possible with this notification technique to wait in the middle
of a monitor service method for a signal and then continue executing
inside the monitor service method at that point after receiving the signal.
The signaled thread has to reenter the monitor via a service method.

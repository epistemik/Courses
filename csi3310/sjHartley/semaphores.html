<P>
<I>Semaphores</I> can be used for mutual exclusion and thread synchronization.
Instead of busy waiting and wasting CPU cycles,
a thread can block on a semaphore (the operating system removes the thread
from the CPU scheduling or ``ready'' queue)
if it must wait to enter its critical section or if the resource
it wants is not available.

<P>
Mutual exclusion pseudocode: <BR>
semaphore S = 1; ...  P(S); N=N+1; V(S);

Condition synchronization pseudocode (resource availability): <BR>
semaphore tapeDrives = 7; ...
P(tapeDrives); useTapeDrive(); V(tapeDrives);

Java does not have explicit binary and <I>counting</I> semaphores,
so they are provided as classes
in the <TT>Synchronization</TT> subdirectory of the <TT>lib</TT> directory.
Their implementation is shown later.
Two explicit binary semaphores, one initialized to zero
(impossible with an implicit binary semaphore),
and one explicit counting semaphore
are used to synchronized three threads so they obey the ``rules.''
The ``syntactic sugar'' in
<A HREF="Semaphores/MyObject.java"><TT>MyObject.java</TT></A>
lets us write <TT>P(S)</TT> instead of <TT>S.P()</TT> for a
semaphore <TT>S</TT>.

A barber waits to cut hair.
Customers enter the waiting room and take a seat if one is available.
If the waiting room is full, they try again later.

Five philosophers sit around a table and think until hungry.
Interspersed between the philosophers are five forks.
A hungry philosopher must have exclusive access to both its left and
right forks in order to eat.
If they are not both free, the philosopher waits.
The following algorithm does not deadlock (it never happens that
all philosophers are hungry, each holding one fork and waiting for the other),
allows maximal parallelism
(a philosopher never picks up and holds a fork while waiting
for the other fork to become available
when the fork it is holding could be used for eating by its neighbor),
an advantage,
but also allows starvation
(a philosopher's two neighbors can collaborate and alternate their
eating so the one in the middle never can use the forks).

<P>
If a philosopher can hold a fork while waiting for the other fork,
deadlock is possible, an extreme case of not having maximal parallelism.
However, starvation is not possible.
Each fork is represented by a semaphore and each hungry philosopher
does a ``P'' on its left fork and then its right fork.

We can fix the deadlock problem and retain no starvation,
but we still do not have maximal parallelism.
All philosophers pick up left then right except one designated
philosopher who picks up right then left.

A database can be accessed concurrently by threads that only want to read,
but a writer thread must have exclusive access with respect to other
readers and writers.
The solution here allows writers to starve if enough readers keep coming along
to read the database that the number of current readers is always above zero.

This sequence of attempts to implement counting semaphores
with binary semaphores
illustrates some of the subtleties of pure binary semaphores and
thread scheduling.
The first two attempts have a problem if a context switch occurs at
point <TT>A</TT> since then <TT>V</TT>'s on the binary semaphore
<TT>blocked</TT> may get lost.
The third solves that problem but introduces more context switching overhead.
The last two are good solutions, with the latter being somewhat simpler.

Jurassic Park consists of a safari area, a number of single-passenger
safari cars, some number of people,  and a museum.
Each person in the park visits the museum for a random amount of time,
then line up to take a safari ride, waiting for an empty car.
Each car waits for a passenger, then goes out on safari for a random
amount of time.
The following solution has a major flaw.
What is it?
How can the flaw be fixed?

<H1>Starvation-Free Monitor for the Unisex Bathroom</H1>

<P>
This is Exercise 5.3 of the text.
</P>

<P>
As in all our programming assignments, use command line arguments
to set the simulation parameters, such as the number of males, females,
baboons of each type, maximum nap time outside the bathroom,
maximum nap time inside the bathroom, etc.
</P>

<P>
Remember that Java monitors are `signal and continue' so be sure
to think about the ramifications of this as you design your monitor,
in particular ``barging''.
No semaphores and no busy waiting allowed.
Do not use <TT>nap()</TT> within a synchronized monitor method.
Do you see why?
Only three <TT>nap()</TT>'s are allowed in this program:
people (baboons) wandering around, people (baboons) using the bathroom
(crossing the canyon on the rope),
and one in <TT>main()</TT> to shut down the simulation.
</P>

<P>
For the purposes of this assignment you may assume that each <TT>notify()</TT>
awakens the thread that has been waiting the longest.
But it is unpredictable when that thread will get back into the monitor.
It is possible for other threads that have called a monitor synchronized
method to ``barge'' in ahead of it.
Also, <TT>notifyAll()</TT> awakens all the waiting threads and it is
unpredictable which thread will get back into the monitor first
and whether another thread will ``barge'' in ahead of it.
</P>

<P>
Describe which of the two approaches to starvation
prevention that we discussed in class you picked to implement:
strict serialization or platooning (batching).
</P>

<P>
Here is one way to approach a monitor programming assignment.
Think of the monitor as maintaining the state of the system
in integer and boolean data fields and the synchronized methods
as making atomic changes to the state of the system.
For example, a call to <TT>maleEnterBathroom()</TT> would check to see
who is currently using the bathroom.
If nobody, then allow the male to enter the bathroom.
If males, then allow the male to enter the bathroom
unless there is a female waiting, in which case
<TT>wait()</TT> until the next batch of males is allowed in.
If females are currently using the bathroom,
then <TT>wait()</TT> until the bathroom is free or until
the next batch of males is allowed in.
The last person to leave the bathroom will check to see
if there are any people of the other gender waiting to use the bathroom
and if so, set a boolean variable <TT>femaleTurn</TT> or <TT>maleTurn</TT>,
as appropriate, and do a <TT>notifyAll()</TT>.
</P>

<P>
If you have not done so already,
animate your program using
<A HREF="../lib/XtangoAnimation/XtangoAnimator.java">
<TT>XtangoAnimator.java</TT></A>.
First do the base assignment as specified above and turn it in.
Then do an animation of it as a separate program.

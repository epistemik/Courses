A few days into
the mission, not long after Pathfinder started gathering meteorological
data, the spacecraft began experiencing total system resets, each
resulting in losses of data.  The press reported these failures in terms
such as ``software glitches'' and ``the computer was trying to do too many
things at once''.
</P>

<P>
This week at the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium I heard a fascinating
keynote address by David Wilner, Chief Technical Officer of Wind River
Systems.  Wind River makes VxWorks, the real-time embedded systems kernel
that was used in the Mars Pathfinder mission.  In his talk, he explained
in detail the actual software problems that caused the total system
resets of the Pathfinder spacecraft, how they were diagnosed, and how
they were solved.  I wanted to share his story with each of you.
</P>

<P>
VxWorks provides preemptive priority scheduling of threads.  Tasks on the
Pathfinder spacecraft were executed as threads with priorities that were
assigned in the usual manner reflecting the relative urgency of these
tasks.
</P>

<P>
Pathfinder contained an ``information bus'', which you can think of as a
shared memory area used for passing information between different
components of the spacecraft.  A bus management task ran frequently with
high priority to move certain kinds of data in and out of the information
bus.  Access to the bus was synchronized with mutual exclusion locks
(mutexes).
</P>

<P>
The meteorological data gathering task ran as an infrequent, low priority
thread, and used the information bus to publish its data.  When
publishing its data, it would acquire a mutex, do writes to the bus, and
release the mutex.  If an interrupt caused the information bus thread to
be scheduled while this mutex was held, and if the information bus thread
then attempted to acquire this same mutex in order to retrieve published
data, this would cause it to block on the mutex, waiting until the
meteorological thread released the mutex before it could continue.  The
spacecraft also contained a communications task that ran with medium
priority.
</P>

<P>
Most of the time this combination worked fine.  However, very
infrequently it was possible for an interrupt to occur that caused the
(medium priority) communications task to be scheduled during the short
interval while the (high priority) information bus thread was blocked
waiting for the (low priority) meteorological data thread.  In this case,
the long-running communications task, having higher priority than the
meteorological task, would prevent it from running, consequently
preventing the blocked information bus task from running.  After some
time had passed, a watchdog timer would go off, notice that the data bus
task had not been executed for some time, conclude that something had
gone drastically wrong, and initiate a total system reset.
</P>

<P>
This scenario is a classic case of priority inversion.
</P>

<H1>How Was this Debugged?</H1>

<P>
VxWorks can be run in a mode where it records a total trace of all
interesting system events, including context switches, uses of
synchronization objects, and interrupts.  After the failure, JPL
engineers spent hours and hours running the system on the exact
spacecraft replica in their lab with tracing turned on, attempting to
replicate the precise conditions under which they believed that the reset
occurred.  Early in the morning, after all but one engineer had gone
home, the engineer finally reproduced a system reset on the replica.
Analysis of the trace revealed the priority inversion.
</P>

<H1>How Was the Problem Corrected?</H1>

<P>
When created, a VxWorks mutex object accepts a boolean parameter that
indicates whether priority inheritance should be performed by the mutex.
The mutex in question had been initialized with the parameter off; had it
been on, the low-priority meteorological thread would have inherited the
priority of the high-priority data bus thread blocked on it while it held
the mutex, causing it be scheduled with higher priority than the
medium-priority communications task, thus preventing the priority
inversion. Once diagnosed, it was clear to the JPL engineers that using
priority inheritance would prevent the resets they were seeing.
</P>

<P>
VxWorks contains a C language interpreter intended to allow developers to
type in C expressions and functions to be executed on the fly during
system debugging.  The JPL engineers fortuitously decided to launch the
spacecraft with this feature still enabled.  By coding convention, the
initialization parameter for the mutex in question (and those for two
others which could have caused the same problem) were stored in global
variables, whose addresses were in symbol tables also included in the
launch software, and available to the C interpreter.  A short C program
was uploaded to the spacecraft, which when interpreted, changed the
values of these variables from FALSE to TRUE.  No more system resets
occurred.
</P>

<H1>Analysis and Lessons</H1>

<P>
First and foremost, diagnosing this problem as a black box would have
been impossible.  Only detailed traces of actual system behavior enabled
the faulty execution sequence to be captured and identified.
</P>

<P>
Secondly, leaving the ``debugging'' facilities in the system saved the day.
Without the ability to modify the system in the field, the problem could
not have been corrected.
</P>

<P>
Finally, the engineer's initial analysis that ``the data bus task executes
very frequently and is time-critical --- we shouldn't spend the extra time
in it to perform priority inheritance'' was exactly wrong.  It is
precisely in such time critical and important situations where
correctness is essential, even at some additional performance cost.
</P>

<H1>Human Nature, Deadline Pressures</H1>

<P>
David told us that the JPL engineers later confessed that one or two
system resets had occurred in their months of pre-flight testing.  They
had never been reproducible or explainable, and so the engineers, in a
very human-nature response of denial, decided that they probably weren't
important, using the rationale ``it was probably caused by a hardware
glitch''.
</P>

<P>
Part of it too was the engineers' focus.  They were extremely focused on
ensuring the quality and flawless operation of the landing software.
Should it have failed, the mission would have been lost.  It is entirely
understandable for the engineers to discount occasional glitches in the
less-critical land-mission software, particularly given that a spacecraft
reset was a viable recovery strategy at that phase of the mission.
</P>

David also said that some of the real heroes of the situation were some
people from CMU who had published a paper he'd heard presented many years
ago who first identified the priority inversion problem and proposed the
solution.  He apologized for not remembering the precise details of the
paper or who wrote it.  Bringing things full circle, it turns out that
the three authors of this result were all in the room, and at the end of
the talk were encouraged by the program chair to stand and be
acknowledged. They were Lui Sha, John Lehoczky, and Raj Rajkumar.  When
was the last time you saw a room of people cheer a group of computer
science theorists for their significant practical contribution to
advancing human knowledge? <TT>:-)</TT>  It was quite a moment.

Here is an ``official'' version of the report on the software problem with
the sojourner lander.  It's pretty much the same with a lot of detail, and
some critical mistakes in the first one corrected.  It was written by the
software team leader, who requested that it be sent to everyone who
received the first letter.
</P>

<H1>What really happened on Mars? --- Authoritative account</H1>

<P>
I am extremely pleased to be able to pass on to you an authoritative
first-hand account of ``What really happened on Mars?'' from Glenn Reeves, who
led the software team for the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft.  Please forward
this to anyone who you sent my original message.
</P>

<P>
But before his message, one other footnote.  Since I sent my original
message, a number of people replied saying that the priority inversion
problem and solutions to it were known much earlier than Sha et al.'s 1990
article.  See
<A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/~mbj/Mars_Pathfinder/Priority_Inversion.html">
this</A>
for a few references to earlier work in the area, if you're interested.  If
you received this but missed my initial message, you can read it
<A HREF="http://research.microsoft.com/~mbj/Mars_Pathfinder/Mars_Pathfinder.html">

<P>
I'm glad so many people seemed to have enjoyed my note.

What really happend on Mars?
</P>

<P>
By now most of you have read Mike's summary of Dave Wilner's
comments given at the IEEE Real-Time Systems Symposium.  I don't know Mike
and I
didn't attend the symposium (though I really wish I had now) and I have not
talked to Dave Wilner since before the talk.  However, I did lead the
software
team for the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft.  So, instead of trying to find out
what
was said I will just tell you what happened.  You can make your own
judgments.
</P>

<P>
I sent this message out to everyone who was a recipient of Mike's original
that
I had an email address for.  Please pass it on to anyone you sent the first
one
to.  Mike, I hope you will post this wherever you posted the original.
</P>

<P>
Since I want to make sure the problem is clearly understood I need to step
through each of the areas which contributed to the problem.
</P>

<H2>The Hardware</H2>

<P>
The simplified view of the Mars Pathfinder hardware architecture looks like
this.  A single CPU controls the spacecraft.  It resides on a VME bus which
also
contains interface cards for the radio, the camera, and an interface to a
1553
bus.  The 1553 bus connects to two places: The ``cruise stage'' part of the
spacecraft and the ''lander'' part of the spacecraft.  The hardware on the
cruise
part of the spacecraft controls thrusters, valves, a sun sensor, and a star
scanner.  The hardware on the lander part provides an interface to
accelerometers, a radar altimeter, and an instrument for meteorological
science
known as the ASI/MET.  The hardware which we used to interface to the 1553
bus
(at both ends) was inherited from the Cassini spacecraft.  This hardware
came
with a specific paradigm for its usage:  the software will schedule
activity at
an 8 Hz rate.  This <I>feature</I> dictated the architecture of the software
which
controls both the 1553 bus and the devices attached to it.
</P>

<H2>The Software Architecture</H2>

<P>
The software to control the 1553 bus and the attached instruments was
implemented as two tasks.  The first task controlled the setup of
transactions
on the 1553 bus (called the bus scheduler or bc_sched task) and the second
task
handled the collection of the transaction results i.e. the data.  The second
task is referred to as the bc_dist (for distribution) task.  A typical
timeline
for the bus activity  for a single cycle is shown below.  It is not to
scale.
This cycle was constantly repeated.
<PRE>
  |&lt; ------------- .125 seconds ------------------------&gt;|

  |&lt;***************|                    |********|   |**&gt;|

                   |&lt;- bc_dist active -&gt;|    bc_sched active
  |&lt; -bus active -&gt;|                             |&lt;-&gt;|


--|----------------|--------------------|--------|---|---|--
  t1               t2                   t3       t4  t5  t1
</PRE>
The <TT>***</TT> are periods when tasks other than the ones listed
are executing.
Yes, there is some idle time.
</P>

<P>
t1 --- bus hardware starts via hardware control on the 8 Hz boundary. The
transactions for this cycle had been set up by the previous execution of
the bc_sched task.<BR>
t2 --- 1553 traffic is complete and the bc_dist task is awakened.<BR>
t3 --- bc_dist task has completed all of the data distribution<BR>
t4 --- bc_sched task is awakened to setup transactions for the next cycle<BR>
t5 --- bc_sched activity is complete<BR>
</P>

<P>
The bc_sched and bc_dist tasks check each cycle to be sure that the other
had
completed its execution.  The bc_sched task is the highest priority task in
the
system (except for the vxWorks ``tExec'' task).  The bc_dist is third highest
(a task controlling the entry and landing is second).  All of the tasks which
perform other spacecraft functions are lower.  Science functions, such as
imaging, image compression, and the ASI/MET task are still lower.
</P>

<P>
Data is collected from devices connected to the 1553 bus only when they are
powered.  Most of the tasks in the system that access the information
collected
over the 1553 do so via a double buffered shared memory mechanism into which
the
bc_dist task places the latest data.  The exception to this is the ASI/MET
task
which is delivered its information via an interprocess communication
mechanism
(IPC).  The IPC mechanism uses the vxWorks pipe() facility.  Tasks wait on
one
or more IPC ``queues'' for messages to arrive.  Tasks use the select()
mechanism
to wait for message arrival.  Multiple queues are used when both high and
lower
priority messages are required.  Most of the IPC traffic in the system is
not
for the delivery of real-time data.  However, again, the exception to this
is
the use of the IPC mechanism with the ASI/MET task.  The cause of the reset
on
Mars was in the use and configuration of the IPC mechanism.
</P>

<H2>The Failure</H2>

<P>
The failure was identified by the spacecraft as a failure of the bc_dist
task to
complete its execution before the bc_sched task started.  The reaction to
this
by the spacecraft was to reset the computer.  This reset reinitializes all
of
the hardware and software. It also terminates the execution of the current
ground commanded activities.  No science or engineering data is lost that
has
already been collected (the data in RAM is recovered so long as power is not
lost).  However, the remainder of the activities for that day were not
accomplished until the next day.
</P>

<P>
The failure turned out to be a case of priority inversion (how we discovered
this and how we fixed it are covered later).  The higher priority bc_dist
task
was blocked by the much lower priority ASI/MET task that was holding a
shared
resource.   The ASI/MET task had acquired this resource and then been
preempted
by several of the medium priority tasks.  When the bc_sched task was
activated,
to setup the transactions for the next 1553 bus cycle, it detected that the
bc_dist task had not completed its execution.  The resource that caused this
problem was a mutual exclusion semaphore used within the select() mechanism
to
control access to the list of file descriptors that the select() mechanism
was
to wait on.
</P>

<P>
The select mechanism creates a mutual exclusion semaphore to protect the
``wait
list'' of file descriptors for those devices which support select.  The
vxWorks
pipe() mechanism is such a device and the IPC mechanism we used is based on
using pipes. The
ASI/MET task had called select, which had called pipeIoctl(), which had
called
selNodeAdd(), which was in the process of giving the mutex semaphore.  The
ASI/MET task was preempted and semGive() was not completed.   Several medium
priority tasks ran until the bc_dist task was activated.  The bc_dist task
attempted to send the newest ASI/MET data via the IPC mechanism which called
pipeWrite().  pipeWrite() blocked,  taking the mutex semaphore.  More of the
medium priority tasks ran, still not allowing the ASI/MET task to run, until
the
bc_sched task was awakened.  At that point, the bc_sched task determined
that
the bc_dist task had not completed its cycle (a hard deadline in the system)
and
declared the error that initiated the reset.
</P>

<H2>How We Found It</H2>

<P>
The software that flies on Mars Pathfinder has several debug features within
it
that are used in the lab but are not used on the flight spacecraft (not used
because some of them produce more information than we can send back to
Earth).
These features were not ``fortuitously'' left enabled but remain in the
software
by design.  We strongly believe in the ``test what you fly and fly what you
test'' philosophy.
</P>

<P>
One of these tools is a trace/log facility which was originally developed to
find a bug in an early version of the vxWorks port (Wind River ported
vxWorks to
the RS6000 processor for us for this mission).  This trace/log facility was
built by David Cummings who was one of the software engineers on the task.
Lisa
Stanley, of Wind River, took this facility and instrumented the pipe
services,
msgQ services, interrupt handling, select services, and the tExec task.  The
facility initializes at startup and continues to collect data (in ring
buffers)
until told to stop.  The facility produces a voluminous dump of information
when asked.
</P>

<P>
After the problem occurred on Mars we did run the same set of activities
over
and over again in the lab.  The bc_sched was already coded so as to stop the
trace/log collection and dump the data (even though we knew we could not get
the
dump in flight) for this error.  So, when we went into the lab to test it we
did
not have to change the software.
</P>

<P>
In less than 18 hours we were able to cause the problem to occur. Once we
were
able to reproduce the failure, the priority inversion problem was obvious.
</P>

<H2>How Was the Problem Corrected</H2>

<P>
Once we understood the problem the fix appeared obvious: change the
creation
flags for the semaphore so as to enable the priority inheritance.  The Wind
River folks, for many of their services, supply global configuration
variables
for parameters such as the ``options'' parameter for the semMCreate used by
the
select service (although this is not documented and those who do not have
vxWorks source code or have not studied the source code might be unaware of
this
feature).  However, the fix is not so obvious for several reasons:
</P>

<P>
1) The code for this is in the selectLib() and is common for all device
creations.  When you change this global variable all of the select
semaphores
created after that point will be created with the new options.  There was no
easy way in our initialization logic to only modify the semaphore associated
with the pipe used for bc_dist task to ASI/MET task communications.
</P>

<P>
2) If we make this change, and it is applied on a global basis, how will
this
change the behavior of the rest of the system?
</P>

<P>
3) The priority inversion option was deliberately left out by Wind River in
the
default selectLib() service for optimum performance.  How will performance
degrade if we turn the priority inversion on ?
</P>

<P>
4) Was there some intrinsic behavior of the select mechanism itself that
would
change if the priority inversion was enabled ?
</P>

<P>
We did end up modifying the global variable to include the priority
inversion.
This corrected the problem.  We asked Wind River to analyze the potential
impacts for (3) and (4). They concluded that the performance impact would be
minimal and that the behavior of select() would not change so long as there
was
always only one task waiting for any particular file descriptor.  This is
true
in our system.  I believe that the debate at Wind River still continues on
whether the priority inversion option should be on as the default.  For (1)
and
(2) the change did alter the characteristics of all of the select
semaphores.
We concluded, both by analysis and test, that there was no adverse behavior.
We tested the system extensively before we changed the software on the
spacecraft.
</P>

<H2>How We Changed the Software on the Spacecraft</H2>

<P>
No, we did not use the vxWorks shell to change the software (although the
shell
is usable on the spacecraft).  The process of ``patching'' the software on the
spacecraft is a specialized process.  It involves sending the differences
between what you have onboard and what you want (and have on Earth) to the
spacecraft.  Custom software on the spacecraft (with a whole bunch of
validation) modifies the onboard copy.  If you want more info you can send
me email.
</P>

<H2>Why Didn't We Catch It before Launch?</H2>

<P>
The problem would only manifest itself when ASI/MET data was being collected
and
intermediate tasks were heavily loaded.  Our before launch testing was
limited
to the ``best case'' high data rates and science activities.  The fact that
data
rates from the surface were higher than anticipated and the amount of
science
activities proportionally greater served to aggravate the problem.  We did
not
expect nor test the ``better than we could have ever imagined'' case.
</P>

<H2>Human Nature, Deadline Pressures</H2>

<P>
We did see the problem before landing but could not get it to repeat when we
tried to track it down.  It was not forgotten nor was it deemed unimportant.
</P>

<P>
Yes, we were concentrating heavily on the entry and landing software.  Yes,
we
considered this problem lower priority.  Yes, we would have liked to have
everything perfect before landing.  However,  I don't see any problem here
other
than we ran out of time to get the lower priority issues completed.
</P>

<P>
We did have one other thing on our side; we knew how robust our system was
because that is the way we designed it.
</P>

<P>
We knew that if this problem occurred we would reset.  We built in
mechanisms to
recover the current activity so that there would be no interruptions in the
science data (although this wasn't used until later in the landed mission).
We
built in the ability (and tested it) to go through multiple resets while we
were
going through the Martian atmosphere.  We designed the software to recover
from
radiation induced errors in the memory or the processor.  The spacecraft
would
have even done a 60 day mission on its own, including deploying the rover,
if
the radio receiver had broken when we landed.  There are a large number of
safeguards in the system to ensure robust, continued operation in the event
of a
failure of this type.  These safeguards allowed us to designate problems of
this
nature as lower priority.
</P>

<P>
We had our priorities right.
</P>

<H2>Analysis and Lessons</H2>

<P>
Did we (the JPL team) make an error in assuming how the select/pipe
mechanism
would work ?  Yes, probably.  But there was no conscious decision to not
have
the priority inversion enabled.  We just missed it.  There are several other
places in the flight software where similar protection is required for
critical
data structures and the semaphores do have priority inversion protection.  A
good lesson when you fly COTS stuff --- make sure you know how it works.
</P>

<P>
Mike is quite correct in saying that we could not have figured this out
<I>ever</I>
if we did not have the tools to give us the insight.  We built many of the
tools
into the software for exactly this type of problem.  We always planned to
leave
them in.  In fact, the shell (and the stdout stream) were very useful the
entire mission.  If you want more detail send me a note.
</P>

<H2>Setting the Record Straight</H2>

<P>
First, I want to make sure that everyone understands how I feel in regard to
Wind River.  These folks did a fantastic job for us.  They were enthusiastic
and
supported us when we came to them and asked them to do an affordable port of
vxWorks.  They delivered the alpha version in 3 months.  When we had a
problem
they put some of the brightest engineers I have ever worked with on the
problem.
Our communication with them was fantastic.  If they had not done such a
professional job the Mars Pathfinder mission would not have been the success
that it is.
</P>

<P>
Second, Dave Wilner did talk to me about this problem before he gave his
talk.
I could not find my notes where I had detailed the description of the
problem.
So, I winged it and I sure did get it wrong.  Sorry Dave.
</P>

<H2>Acknowledgments</H2>

<P>
First, thanks to Mike for writing a very nice description of the talk.  I
think
I have had probably 400 people send me copies.  You gave me the push to
write
the part of the Mars Pathfinder End-of-Mission report that I had been
procrastinating doing.
</P>

A special thanks to Steve Stolper for helping me do this.

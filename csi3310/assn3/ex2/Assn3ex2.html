<BLOCKQUOTE><B><FONT size=+2>A TRAFFIC CONTROLLER FOR A NARROW TUNNEL</FONT></B> 
  <FONT size=+1><P>We have a 2-lane road (one lane is in the northbound direction and the
  other is in the southbound direction) that goes through a narrow tunnel. There
  were so many accidents in this tunnel that it was decided to install a set of
  traffic lights and sensors (automobile detectors) at both entrances of the
  tunnel that are to be connected to a computer controller.&nbsp; When a car
  tries to enter the tunnel, it first passes by a sensor which sends a signal to
  the controller. The controller then decides to display a GREEN light or a RED
  light (there are no yellow lights). The car must wait in a queue when the
  light is RED, otherwise it can enter the tunnel. At any time, the controller
  must assure that there can be in the tunnel only cars that are traveling along
  the same direction (otherwise an accident may occur). For example, if there
  are one or more cars in the tunnel that are traveling along the southbound
  direction, no northbound car should be permitted to enter but southbound cars
  my be permitted to enter. If there are no cars in the tunnel, the first car
  that tries to enter in the tunnel should be admitted no matter what is its
  traveling direction.
  <P>In this assignment, you must perform all thread synchronization and mutual
  exclusion by using only Java monitors (ie: Java objects with synchronize
  methods). You are not permitted to construct semaphores and use them (since
  that was the method used in the previous assignment). <BR>&nbsp;
  <H3>Programming exercise 1</H3>The tunnel controller has 2 public methods,
  northbound_arrival() and southbound_arrival(), that cars need to call when
  they try to enter the tunnel. These methods return either "RED" or "GREEN"
  depending on the controller's decision. A car must wait in queue on "RED",
  otherwise it may enter the tunnel. Use a northbound queue and a southbound
  queue. The tunnel controller has 2 public methods, northbound_departure() and
  southbound_departure() that cars must call when they exit the tunnel (since
  they pass by sensors when they exit the tunnel). To examine the output of your
  program, these methods should print a message to indicate which car is leaving
  the tunnel; hence a integer car_identification should be passed to these
  methods. (Of course, these departure methods will need to perform some other
  tasks for the controller.)
  <P>The controller should display the state of the traffic lights whenever one
  of the lights changes its state. The controller can change the state of a
  traffic light only when a car request to enter in the tunnel.
  <P>In addition to the tunnel controller, you need to simulate some car
  traffic. There are two types of cars: northbound cars that are calling
  northbound methods of the tunnel controller, and southbound cars that are
  calling southbound methods. Each car is a Thread that is performing the
  following loop infinitely often: It first try to enter the tunnel by calling
  the appropriate arrival method. If the light is RED then it must wait in the
  appropriate queue, otherwise it can enter the tunnel. When it is permitted to
  enter the tunnel, a car first print on screen that it is entering the tunnel
  and then it goes to sleep for 1 msec. Then it calls the appropriate departure
  method which will print a message indicating that this car is leaving the
  tunnel (also, the departure method should notify the appropriate queue if
  there are no more cars in the tunnel). Finally, after calling a departure
  method, a car goes to sleep for 1 to 5 msec before trying to reenter again in
  the same direction as before (and this cycle repeats infinitely often).
  <P>After creating the appropriate objects, your main program creates an array
  of 3 northbound cars and 3 southbound cars and then start these six threads.
  Here is the <A
  href="out3_1a.txt">output
  file</A> obtained from my program. Notice that, at any time, no two cars that
  are traveling along opposite directions are in the tunnel. Also, in contrast
  with ordinary (and stupid) traffic lights, no car has to wait to enter the
  tunnel when there are no cars in the tunnel.
  <P>However this solution has a problem. Look at this other <A
  href="out3_1b.txt">output
  file</A> when I use a traffic of 6 northbound cars and 3 southbound cars.
  Notice that southbound cars are forced to wait for an unfair amount of time
  and can hardly get into the tunnel. I'm asking you to fix this problem for the
  second exercise. <BR>&nbsp;
  <H3>Programming exercise 2</H3>Modify the tunnel controller of the previous
  exercise in the following way: when a car waits in queue, the controller
  cannot permit more than X consecutive cars to enter the tunnel in the opposite
  direction. Use the value of 5 for this amount X and use a traffic of 6
  northbound cars and 3 southbound cars. Look at the <A
  href="out3_2.txt">output
  file</A> I have obtained. You can see that no more than 5 consecutive cars can
  enter the tunnel when there is a waiting queue of cars in the opposite
  direction. (Indeed, we can see that by the fact that there is always a light
  change from GREEN to RED when a car is forced to wait and starts a new waiting
  queue.)<BR><BR>

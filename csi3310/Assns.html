<h2>
Directives for CSI 3310 and CSI 3710 assignments</h2>

<blockquote>There will about four assignments during this course. Each
assignment will be posted at the end of this page.
<p>The assignments consist of <b>programming exercises</b> only. You will
also find, from the main CSI3310 (and CSI3710) course page, some theoretical
exercises which will not be marked. These theoretical exercises are not
part of any assignment; they are provided to improve your knowledge and
your preparation for the final exam.
<p><b>You must hand your assignments electronically by email to the specified
TA</b> who will mark your assignment and return to you by email your annotated
assignment and your mark. Hence you will be able to send your assignments
directly from the comfort of your home but, conversely, <b>we will not
accept assignments in hard-copy form.</b>
<p>Normally, you will be given about 8-10 days to do your assignments.
Since the Internet is reliable, the specified deadline to return your assignment
is HARD (and final). <b><font color="#FF0000">No late copy will be accepted!!!</font></b>
<p>Assignments must be done individually. <b><font color="#000000">If this
is not the case, your mark will be divided by the number of teammates!</font></b>
<p>The specified TA to whom you will sent your assignment may vary from
one assignment to the other: it will be specified on the assignment.
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h3>
To submit your assignment you must follow precisely all these directives:</h3>

<blockquote>Each assignment consists of (one or more) programming exercises.
You should provide one folder per programming exercise and each folder
will contain all your JAVA source files for that programming exercise.
Each folder must be named&nbsp; according to the assignment number and
the programming exercise of that assignment. For example, all the JAVA
source files of programming exercise 2 of assignment 3 must be placed in
a folder named <b>ass3-2</b> (in lower case). Moreover the files must be
MS-DOS/Windows95/98 files. <b>You must provide only the source .JAVA files.
We will not accept executable .CLASS files</b>. The TA will personally
generate the executable from each source and then run that executable only.
(We think that, in previous years, some students cheated by sending an
executable which did not come from their source file. This is one of the
reasons why we do not accept executables anymore.)
<p>By using the <a href="http://www.winzip.com/">WinZip</a> utility, you
must archive together all the folders of the same assignment into a <b>single</b>
.ZIP file and then attached this .ZIP file with an email message that you
will send to the specified TA. You must name the .ZIP file according to
the assignment number and your student number. For example, student number
1673458 must name the .ZIP file of assignment 3 as: <b>ass3u1673458.zip</b>
(in lower case).
<p>This .ZIP file must be attached to an email message that must be sent
to the specified TA. The subject of your email message must match the assignment
number. For example, for assignment 3, the subject line must be <b>handing
assignment 3 of CSI 3310/3710</b>. The body of your message must start
with the following 2 lines:
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Student Name: your name
<br>Student Number: your student number</blockquote>

<p><br>After that, you can include in the message body an important comment
to the TA. But please, include a comment only if it is necessary!
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>

<h3>
Feedback from the TA</h3>

<blockquote>The TA who will mark your assignment will send you an email
reply as soon as he receives your assignment. This should be done within
one or two working days. Hence, if you send your assignment very close
to the deadline, you might receive the reply only after the deadline...
<p>The TA who will mark you assignment will send you back an email message
that will contain the information of where and why you have lost some points
(assuming that you have lost some points). Attached with this message will
be your original .ZIP file containing your sources that will possibly be
annotated by the marker to point to errors. The message body will also
contain your overall mark for that assignment.</blockquote>

<h3>
<b>Potential problems with email clients</b></h3>

<blockquote><b>It is your responsibility to use an email client that handles
email attachments correctly. </b>Both Netscape Messenger (part of Netscape
Communicator) and Microsoft Outlook Express handle email attachments cleanly.
Hence I suggest that you use either one of these email clients. If you
use another email client, please check that it handles attachments correctly
by sending to one of your friend (that uses either Netscape Messenger or
Outlook Express) an email with one .ZIP file attached.</blockquote>

<h3>
Potential problems with email servers</h3>

<blockquote><b>You might not be able to send an email to anyone within
the uottawa.ca domain by using the email server of your ISP</b>. This is
because some ISP email servers are "Open Relay" servers which means that
basically anybody can use these servers for sending their email. Hence
spammers are using extensively these Open Relay servers to send their email
junk. To help reduce the amount of email spam that gets into uottawa and
to force email servers not to be "Open Relay" both UofO and SITE email
servers are not accepting any email message that comes from these "Open
Relay" servers. If the email server of your ISP is an Open Relay, all your
email messages send from your home to uottawa.ca will probably bounce.
In that case you can follow the instructions provided by the returned error
message to resend back your email message. You will probably only need
to attach a key to the user id to whom you want to send your message. The
key is likely to be "notspam". If this is the case, to send an email to
marchand, you should send it to marchand+notspam (with the rest of the
email address unchanged). If this does not work, then you will need to
send your email message within the uottawa.ca domain (ex: from the cube).
<b>Bouncing email messages will not be considered as a valid excuse of
having failed to send your assignment within the deadline.</b></blockquote>

<h3>
Appeal for an unsatisfactory mark</h3>

<blockquote>Marking is made by TAs which can make mistakes. Hence if you
think there was an error made by the TA who marked your assignment please
send your request to the TA (not to me!) by email with the subject line:
<b>Request to review mark of assignment x of CSI 3310/3710</b>. In the
body of the message, explain why you think that there was an error made
in the marking. Attached with this message, send the exact .ZIP file that
the marker returned to you by email attachment with your mark. (Then the
marker will compare the .ZIP file you send with the one it has sent to
you.)
<p>Please note that marking is done uniformly over every copy by using
the same marking scheme. Hence you cannot appeal for a bad mark because
you do not agree with the marking scheme that was used. You can only appeal
if you think that there was a mistake. The TA will change your mark only
if a mistake was done. So this will occur rarely...</blockquote>

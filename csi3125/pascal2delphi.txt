   from after the {$R *.RES} line to the end of the file.

5. Choose File/Save Project As... and go to the desired
   folder, then click OK to save Unit1 as Unit1.pas,
   then when the second window comes up, pick a new name
   for the program and save as a Delphi project(*.dpr) 

6. Add any other needed units to the 'uses' section as
   e.g. btadt in 'btadt.pas' .

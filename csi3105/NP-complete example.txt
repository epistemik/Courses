Proving HAMILTON CYCLE is polynomially reducible to TSP (here TSP is the
decision form of the problem):

Consider the transformation TRAN from class.  There are 3 things we must
prove:

a)  TRAN is in P.

b)  If the answer is yes for HAMILTON CYCLE, then the answer is yes for     
    the TSP problem we formed.

c)  If the answer is yes for the TSP problem we formed, then the answer is 
    yes for the HAMILTON CYCLE problem.

Proof of a):  Given an adjacency matrix for G*, it will be at most
              ORDER(n^2) work to create the adjacency matrix for the TSP
              problem graph we form.  So TRAN is a polynomial-time algorithm.


Proof of b):  Suppose we have a yes answer for the HAMILTON CYCLE problem,
              i.e. we have a cycle v1, v2, ..., vn in G* which visits all the
              nodes, and has n edges.  This cycle is a tour in our TSP
              problem graph G, and it's cost is n.  So we have a yes answer
              for the TSP problem.

Proof of c):  Suppose we have a tour of cost <= n in the TSP problem we
              formed.  Since this tour contains n edges, and each edge has
              weight >=1 in G, we must have that this tour has cost exactly
              n, and every edge in it has cost 1.  This means that all the
              edges in the tour are edges in the HAMILTON CYCLE graph G*,
              and thus the tour corresponds to a cycle in G* which visits all
              the nodes.

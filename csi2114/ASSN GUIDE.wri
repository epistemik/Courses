CSI 2114 (C/D)    Data Structures     Summer 1999Guidelines for Assignments:Developed by: Franck Binard, Chris Lankester, Adam Murray, Igor Sales, andSam ScottPlease observe the following guidelines for handing in assignments.  The TAsreserve the right to deduct marks if you fail to comply with these rules:1. Hand in the assignment on time.2. Enclose everything in an envelope with your name, student number, and DGDgroup on the front and put it in the locked box on the third floor ofMacDonald hall.  E-mailed assignments are not accepted.  If you are handingin a French assignment, make sure you indicate this on the front of theenvelope.3. Always hand in executable files on disk in addition to the pascal files. Use the executable file name specified in the assignment handout (e.g."a1test.exe" for assignment 1).  Of course if your program won't compile,you can't comply with this rule, but see point 8 below.4. Check your disk for viruses just before you put it into the envelope (usethe F-Prot virus-scanning software available through the cube.)5. Always include a printout of your code with the code you wrotehighlighted using a highlighter or colored pen.  Also, make sure your codeis layed out nicely with procedure header comments, clearly marked sections,and consistent indenting.6. Always label your disk with your name, student number, and discussiongroup.7. Always include an identify procedure in your program which prints yourname, student number, etc.  Make sure the main program calls this procedureat the very beginning.  Use the template below for the IdentifyMyselfprocedure.(************************ IDENTIFICATION **************************)(* Change this procedure to identify yourself *)procedure IdentifyMyself;begin    writeln;    writeln('***** Student Name:    Jane Doe');    writeln('***** Student Number:  00000000');    writeln('***** Professor Name:  June Roe');    writeln('***** Course Number:   CSI0000');    writeln('***** T.A. Name:       John Poe');    writeln('***** Tutorial Number: 0');  writeln;end;8. If your program doesn't work properly, include a written statement ofwhat the problem seems to be, where in the code you think it is, and anyideas you had on what the problem might be.

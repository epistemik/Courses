Four rules for mapping an ER diagram into a database schema are:
\begin{itemize}
\item[(i)] Each regular entity type maps into a base relation.
The primary key is underlined.
\item[(ii)] Each many-to-many relationship also maps into a base relation.
The participating foreign keys may be chosen as the primary key.
\item[(iii)] Many-to-one relationships do {\it not} map into a base relation.
Instead, we simply introduce a foreign key on the many side of the 
relationship.
\item[(iv)] Weak entities map into a base relation, but the foreign keys
rules must be set to CASCADE. The primary key may be chosen as the
weak entity discriminator together with the primary key of the
regular entity.
\end{itemize}

By rule (i), the database will contain the following three relations:

\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE dept (
	d#	char(10) NOT NULL,
	dname	char(10),
	PRIMARY KEY (d#));

CREATE TABLE project (
	pname	char(10) NOT NULL,
	pcity	char(10),
	PRIMARY KEY (p#));

CREATE TABLE employee (
	e#	char(10) NOT NULL,
	ename	char(10),
	PRIMARY KEY (e#));
\end{verbatim}

By rule (ii), the database will contain the following relation:

\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE works (
	d#	char(10) NOT NULL,
	e#	char(10) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (d#,e#),
	FOREIGN KEY (d#) REFERENCES dept
		ON DELETE RESTRICTED
		ON UPDATE CASCADE,
	FOREIGN KEY (e#) REFERENCES employee
		ON DELETE RESTRICTED
		ON UPDATE CASCADE);
\end{verbatim}

\newpage
By rule (iii), we modify the definition of the employee relation:

\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE employee (
	e#	char(10) NOT NULL,
	ename	char(10),
	pname	char(10) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (e#));
	FOREIGN KEY (pname) REFERENCES project
		ON DELETE RESTRICTED
		ON UPDATE CASCADE);
\end{verbatim}

By rule (iv), we have the following base relation:

\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE dependent (
	dname	char(10) NOT NULL,
	e#	char(10) NOT NULL,
	PRIMARY KEY (dname,e#),
	FOREIGN KEY (e#) REFERENCES employee
		ON DELETE CASCADE
		ON UPDATE CASCADE);
\end{verbatim}
\end{document}

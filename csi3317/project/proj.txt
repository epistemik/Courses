create table Dept (
Dnumber CHAR(12),
Name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
constraint PK_DEPT_DNUMBER PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber) );

create table Employee (
Enumber CHAR(12),
Ename VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
constraint PK_EMPLOYEE_ENUMBER PRIMARY KEY (Enumber) );

create table Project (
Name VARCHAR2(50),
City VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
constraint PK_PROJECT_NAME PRIMARY KEY (Name));

create table Works (
Dnumber CHAR(12),
Enumber CHAR(12),
constraint PK_WORKS_DE PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber, Enumber),
constraint FK_WORKS_DNUMBER FOREIGN KEY (Dnumber) REFERENCES Dept,
constraint FK_WORKS_ENUMBER FOREIGN KEY (Enumber) REFERENCES Employee );

create table Works_On (
Enumber CHAR(12),
Name VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
constraint PK_WORKS_ON_ENUMBER PRIMARY KEY (Enumber),
constraint FK_WORKS_ON_ENUMBER FOREIGN KEY (Enumber) REFERENCES Employee,
constraint FK_WORKS_ON_NAME FOREIGN KEY (Name) REFERENCES Project );

create table Dependent (
Dname VARCHAR2(50),
Enumber CHAR(12),
constraint PK_DEPENDENT_DE PRIMARY KEY (Dname, Enumber),
constraint FK_DEPENDENT_ENUMBER FOREIGN KEY (Enumber) REFERENCES Employee
           on delete cascade );


Assumptions

1.  Dept Number and Employee Number in the diagram are different numbers.
2.  Since 'Number' is a reserved word in Oracle, we can use Dnumber  
    and Enumber instead in Dept and Employee respectively.
3.  The 'Number' attributes may contain alphabetic characters but are
    a fixed size.
4.  12 places is enough space for the Number type attributes.
5.  50 places (more than half a line) is enough maximum space for 
    the Name and City type attributes.
6.  Non-PK attributes should not be null.
7.  No distinct table for relationship set Emp_Dep is required.
8.  Since entity set Employee is not existence dependent on entity set Project,
    it is preferable to have an explicit table for relationship set Works_On. 
9. Since Oracle 8i does not support the 'update cascade' foreign key constraint,
    update cascade actions for Dependent and wherever else desired will have 
    to be implemented with triggers.
10. In the other table definitions, the default foreign key operation
    for delete and update (i.e. no action) is acceptable.

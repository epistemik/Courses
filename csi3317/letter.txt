
Good day,

	As I mentioned after class on Monday, I set up the WinRDBI at home and in the CUBE to try the queries for assignment 1.
	As explained on the web page for WinRDBI, you have to modify the start script for the WinRDBI
	to point at the JRE/1.3/bin/javaw.exe file on your system and when I did this it would run.
	There are still some bugs - when setting up an attribute in a  relation it is supposed to
	give you a choice of char or numeric type, but for me you can never choose the numeric type
	- you have to edit the rdb file in a text editor to change an attribute type to numeric.
	Other than this, queries seemed to work fine, except for 'forall' queries in the tuple calculus.
	I entered the example data we did in class and tried the queries from class.
	The 'forall' query we did - "find students taking all courses" - doesn't work for me.
	Checking the examples that come with WinRDBI, a forall clause has the quantification over an implication statement,
	not a conjunction, and setting up the query like this gave me the right answer.  You can see what I did in the attachments.
	I wondered if somehow my set-up is still not right, and wanted to get some confirmation that this query does work for you
	as we did it in class, or that somehow WinRDBI 2.0 is now using a different syntax?
	Also, regarding question 3 of the assignment, is it possible to do this using the WinRDBI syntax?
	This is a trivial question to answer using the syntax in the textbook, where you do not have to specify
	the relation of the output tuples, but for WinRDBI, where you must specify the output is from
	e.g. supplier, or supplier and project, and you can't have something like { S.city or J.city | supplier(S)... },
	I can't see how you can get a single query that will combine attributes from separate relations.
	I would just like to know that this is indeed possible in WinRDBI before I spend any more time on this question.

thanks,

Note that some results will be left to the reader to confirm.

1. Consider a scheme R = {A,B,C,D,E} and the set F of FDs:
F = { AB rightarrow CDE, A rightarrow DE, D rightarrow E }.

(i) Using the definition of 2NF, explain whether R is in 2NF or not.

Defn: A relation scheme R is in 2NF with respect to a set F
of FDs if it is in 1NF and every nonprime attribute is fully dependent
on every candidate key of R.

Thereby, R is not in 2NF since nonprime attributes D and E
are partially dependent upon the candidate key AB.

(ii) Decompose R into 2NF, and not 3NF, preserving all dependencies.

If we normalize R = {A,B,C,D,E} using the problem FD
A rightarrow DE, we obtain
R_1 = {A,D,E} and R_2 = {A,B,C}.
The set F_1 of FDs over R_1 is 
F_1 = { A rightarrow DE, D rightarrow E }.
The set F_2 of FDs over R_2 is 
F_1 = { AB rightarrow C }.
Notice that we have preserved all the dependencies
since F_1 cup F_2 equiv F.
It can be verified that R_1 and R_2 are in 2NF.

2. Using the database scheme {R_1,R_2,ldots,R_n} and the corresponding
sets F_1,F_2,ldots,F_n of FDs obtained from question (1.ii):

(i) Using the definition of 3NF, explain whether each R_i is in 
3NF or not.

Defn: A relation scheme R is in 3NF with respect to a set F
of FDs if no nonprime attribute is transitively dependent
upon a candidate key of R.

Defn: Given a relation scheme R, a subset X of R,
an attribute A in R, and a set F of FDs.
Attribute A is transitively dependent upon X
in R if there is a subset Y of R with
X rightarrow Y, Y notrightarrow X, Y rightarrow A,
under F and A notin XY. 

Thereby, R_1 = {A,D,E} is not in 3NF since
A rightarrow D, D notrightarrow A, D rightarrow E,
under F and E notin AD.
It can be verified that R_2 is in 3NF.

(ii) Decompose the database scheme into 3NF preserving all dependencies.

If we normalize R_1 = {A,D,E} using the FD D rightarrow E,
we obtain R_{11} = {D,E} and R_{12} = {A,D}.
The set F_{11} of FDs over R_{11} is
F_{11} = { D rightarrow E }.
The set F_{12} of FDs over R_{12} is
F_{12} = { A rightarrow D }.
Notice that we have preserved all FDs since
F_{11} cup F_{12} equiv F_1 or
F_{11} cup F_{12} cup F_1 equiv F.
It can be verified that R_{11} and R_{12} are in 3NF.

3. Consider a scheme R = {A,B,C,D,E} and the set F of FDs:
F = { A rightarrow BCDE, CD rightarrow E, EC rightarrow B }.


(i) Decompose R into 3NF preserving all dependencies.
(Hint: notice that E is transitively upon the CK A, as is B.)


Scheme R = {A,B,C,D,E} is not in 3NF with respect to F since
E is transitively upon the CK A, as is B.

Suppose we eliminate the transitive dependency of
E upon A via CD using the FD CD rightarrow E.
We obtain R_1 = {C,D,E} and R_2 = {A,B,C,D}.
The set F_1 of FDs over R_1 is F_1 = { CD rightarrow E }.
The set F_2 of FDs over R_2 is F_2 = { A rightarrow BCD }.
However, this decomposition does not preserve the dependencies.
F_1 cup F_2 notequiv F since
F_1 cup F_2 notmodels EC rightarrow B.
In other words, we have lost the FD EC rightarrow B.

Thereby, let us eliminate the transitive dependence of B
upon A via EC using the FD EC rightarrow B.
We obtain R_1 = {B,C,E} and R_2 = {A,C,D,E}.
The set F_1 of FDs over R_1 is F_1 = { EC rightarrow B }.
The set F_2 of FDs over R_2 is 
F_2 = { A rightarrow CDE, CDrightarrow E }.
Notice that we have preserved all FDs since
F_1 cup F_2 equiv F.
It can be verified that
R_1 is in 3NF with respect to F_1.
However, R_2 = {A,B,C,D} is not in 3NF
with respect to F_2 since E is still
transitive dependent upon CK A via CD.
If we eliminate this transitive dependency
using the FD CD rightarrow E,
we obtain R_{21} = {C,D,E} and R_22 = {A,C,D}.
The set F_21 of FDs over R_21 is F_21 = { CD rightarrow E }.
The set F_22 of FDs over R_22 is F_22 = { A rightarrow CD }.
Notice that we have preserved all FDs since
F_{21} cup F_{22} equiv F_2 or
F_{21} cup F_{22} cup F_{2} equiv F.
It can be verified that R_21 and R_{22} are in 3NF
with respect to F_21 and F_22, respectively. 


4. Consider a scheme R = {A,B,C} and the set F of FDs:
F = { AB rightarrow C, C rightarrow B }.


(i) Using the definition of BCNF, explain whether R is in BCNF or not. 

Defn: A relation scheme R is in BCNF with respect to a set F
of FDs if no attribute is transitively dependent
upon any candidate key of R.

Thereby, R = {A,B,C} is not in BCNF with respect to F
since B is transitively dependent upon CK AB.

(ii) Decompose R into BCNF preserving all dependencies. 

This is not possible! 

If we normalize R = {A,B,C} using the FD
AB rightarrow C, we obtain
R_1 = {A,B,C} and R_2 = {A,C}.
The set F_1 of FDs over R_1 is
F_1 = { AB rightarrow C }.
Obviously, R_1 and F_1 are identical to R and F.
Hence normalizing R using the FD AB rightarrow C
does not benefit us.

If we normalize R = {A,B,C} using the FD
C rightarrow B, we obtain
R_1 = {C,B} and R_2 = {A,C}.
The set F_1 of FDs over R_1 is
F_1 = { C rightarrow B }.
The set F_2 of FDs over R_2 is
F_2 = { AC rightarrow AC }.
However, this decomposition does not preserve dependencies.
F_{1} cup F_{2} notequiv F since
F_{1} cup F_{2} notmodels AB rightarrow C.
In other words, even though R_1 is in BCNF with respect to
F_1 and R_2 is in BCNF with respect to F_2,
we have lost the FD AB rightarrow C.
This example demonstrates that forcing the database scheme
into BCNF may result in some dependencies being lost. 


5. For this question we are {em only} concerned with 4NF.
No MVD axioms are required in determining the answer.
Consider a scheme R = {A,B,C,D,E,I} and the set MF of MVDs and FDs:
MF = { A rightarrowrightarrow BCD, B rightarrow AC, C rightarrow D }.


(i) Explain whether the MVD A rightarrowrightarrow BCD is trivial with
respect to R.  


Defn: Let X,Y subseteq R. An MVD X rightarrowrightarrow Y is
trivial if either (or both) of the following conditions hold:
(i) Y subseteq X,
(ii) XY=R.

The MVD A rightarrowrightarrow BCD is not trivial with
respect to R = {A,B,C,D,E,I} since
BCD notsubseteq A and ABCD neq ABCDEI.


(ii) Decompose R into 4NF. To test your understanding, I insist
that you use the MVD A rightarrowrightarrow BCD first. 


Defn: A relation scheme R is in 4NF if for every MVD
X rightarrowrightarrow Y, either the MVD is trivial
or X contains a CK for R. 

If we normalize R using the MVD A rightarrowrightarrow BCD,
we obtain
R_1 = {A,B,C,D} and R_2 = {A,E,I}.

Theorem 1 in the class notes indicates that an FD X rightarrow Y
is also the MVD X rightarrowrightarrow Y.
The set MF_1 of MVDs and FDs over R_1 is
MF_1 = { A rightarrowrightarrow BCD,
B rightarrowrightarrow AC,
C rightarrowrightarrow D,
B rightarrow AC,
C rightarrow D }.
The set MF_2 of MVDs and FDs over R_2 is
(for our purposes here) MF_2 = { AEI rightarrow AEI }.

Let us check if R_1 is in 4NF with respect to MF_1.
The MVD A rightarrowrightarrow BCD is a trivial
MVD by condition (ii) since ABCD = R.
The MVD B rightarrowrightarrow AC is not a trivial MVD.
However, B is a CK for R_1 since B^+ = BACD = R_1.
Therefore, we do not normalize R_1 with it. The MVD
C rightarrowrightarrow D is not a trivial MVD.
C is not a CK for R_1 since C^+ = CD neq R_1.
Therefore, R_1 is not in 4NF since the MVD
C rightarrowrightarrow D is not trivial and C
is not a CK.
On the other hand, R_2 is in 4NF with respect to
MF_2 = { AEI rightarrow AEI }. 

Normalizing R_1 using C rightarrowrightarrow D,
we obtain R_{11} = {C,D} and R_{12} = {A,B,C}.
The set MF_{11} of MVDs and FDs over R_{11} is
MF_{11} = { C rightarrowrightarrow D, C rightarrow D }.
The set MF_{12} of MVDs and FDs over R_{12} is
MF_{12} = { B rightarrowrightarrow AC,~ B rightarrow AC }.
It can be verified that R_{11} and R_{12} are in 4NF, respectively. 


6. Prove that any relation scheme R in 3NF with respect to a
set F of FDs must be in 2NF with respect to F.
(Hint: prove by contrapositive, namely, show that a partial dependency
implies a transitive dependency.)


Proof: We assume that R is in 3NF. We will assume
that a partial dependency holds and derive a contradiction.

Assume that nonprime attribute A in R is
partially dependent upon a CK K of R. In other words,
there is a proper subset K^prime of K such that
K^prime rightarrow A holds.

First of all, we know that K^prime notrightarrow K;
as otherwise K^prime rightarrow K would mean that
K^prime is a CK contradicting the initial
assumption that K is a CK.

Second, we know that A notin K since K is a CK and
A is nonprime. (Clearly, A notin K^prime as well.)

Then we have
K rightarrow K^prime,~K^prime notrightarrow K,~
K^prime rightarrow A,~A notin K.

By definition, A is transitively dependent upon CK K.
Therefore, R is not in 3NF contradicting our initial assumption.

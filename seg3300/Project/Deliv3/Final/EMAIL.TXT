Date: Thursday, April 05, 2001 11:54 AM

Dear Student u1907299:

1)  First of all, keep it simple.  You did (pseudo-) code for 3 methods in
part 3) of Deliverable 3.  All you do is to rank these 3 methods in terms
of complexity, e.g., SIMPLE, AVERAGE, COMPLEX.  Calculate a value for
Estimated Lines of Cide (ELOC) for each type you have.  For example,
suppose methods M1, M2, M3 have 16, 36, and 40 LOC respectively.  You
judge that M1 is SIMPLE, M2 and M3 are AVERAGE, and COMPLEX would take
about the same number of LOC MORE than AVERAGE as AVERAGE has MORE LOC
than SIMPLE.

So you estimate:

   SIMPLE = 16 LOC

   AVERAGE = (36 + 40)/2 = 38 LOC

   COMPLEX = 38 + (38-16)
           = 38 + 22
           = 60 LOC

Now you look at every method in your class diagram and estimate whether it
will be SIMPLE, AVERAGE, or COMPLEX.  Give the reasons for your estimate.
Then, sum up all the LOC based on the complexities of ALL methods in the
class diagram of part 2) to yield your overall LOC estimate.  Try to
indicate what percentage will be declarative code, what percentage will
probably be reusing definitions from class librariies (if any), and what
percentage will likely be executable code.

2)  Remember to follow the boiler plate standard for deliverable hand-ins.

3)  Remember to include the old (from deliverable 2) scenarios you derived
the collaboration diagrams from in part 1. as an Appendix, or if your
scenarios have changed radically since Deliverable 2, please include the
new scenarios (4 of them) in Appendix 1 for reference for the markers.

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Subject: Reminder about Statement of Participation
Date: Wednesday, April 04, 2001 3:53 PM

Dear Students,

Please remember that as part of Deliverable #3, you are to hand in a
description signed by all members of the team of the degree of
contribution of effort that each of you made to each deliverable.  
This is required so that the allocation of marks can be fairly assigned.

A very simple table would suffice, for example, 

   THE EXAMPLE TEAM

   Student    |  D1  |  D2  |  D3
---------------------------------
  Bob Brown   | more | avg  | more
---------------------------------
  Julie Jones | avg  | avg  | more
---------------------------------
  Trudy Taylor| less | avg  | less
---------------------------------
  Ted White   | avg  | avg  | avg

The rows are the names of the students, and the columns are D1, D2, and D3
for Deliverable 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

In each entry in the table, the students are to indicate whether their
contribution was average, more than average (between the members of the
team), or less than average (between the members of the team).


Please make sure that each member of the team signs next to his/her name.

Thank you for your assistance in arriving at a fair allocation of the
grades.

Reminder:  Please check the Web next week.  All assignments, deliverables,
and mid-term marks will be posted.  Please verify that your grades are as
posted to the best of your knowledge.  If there are any problems, please
send me an email before the exam date.

The final exam is at 2:00 p.m. on Tuesday, April 24, 2001 in GYM B.

Have an enjoyable Easter break and all the best on all of your
assignments.

Professor Probert

Dear Sara,

As I mentioned in class, the expresion "collaboration diagrams" in
question 1 implies scenarios, i.e., more than one scenario.  Therefore,
we wish you to hand 4 collaboration diagrams, 1 for a primary scenario,
and 3 secondary scenarios.  The scenarios should be included in an
appendix.  You can simplify your secondary scenarios collaboration
diagrams by not repeating initial or final message interactions from the 
primary scenario.  Indicate clearly where you left the primary
scenario and where you retun to it (if you do).

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Dear Students,

For Question 1 to assist the markers, please hand in the primary scenarios
and three secondary scenarios from Deliverable 2 which you had chosen to
make collaboration diagrams from.  The best place to include these
scenarios is as an Appendix.

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

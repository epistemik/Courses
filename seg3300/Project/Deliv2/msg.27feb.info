Good Morning,

	Based on class yesterday, I have my doubts now that secondary 
scenario #2 I suggested is actually a secondary scenario.  Prof.Probert 
seems to want secondary scenarios to be high risk situations, so I 
thought we should change the ending of this scenario to one where the 
user does not insert any cash, or perhaps not sufficient cash, to cover 
the rental, then the system has to deal with this.   If we go with "not 
enough cash", then I guess we should have the system display a 
message requesting more cash, then timing out finally, returning the 
previously deposited money, and cancelling the transaction.  Pat - this 
will impact on your sections most, so let me know if you have any 
objections to this change or another suggestion. 

	Other than that, I think we should all have our initial drafts done by 
now.  So, by Friday at the latest, we should send these versions to each 
other so we have the weekend to look over each other's stuff and 
harmonize any different ideas we have, and make suggestions for the 
overall group effort.  Then we can have final versions ready for assembly 
into the boilerplate for early next week.  If there are any significant 
disagreements, then we may want to meet next Tues. or Wed. to deal 
with it.

cheers, 

Mark.

Hi,

 Re the core use case for deliverable #2, it seems pretty clear that it has
to be Renting a cassette, so we need the primary scenario and 3 
secondary scenarios for this case.  I have come up with some 
suggestions below for what I think are some typical and not too involved 
scenarios.  I have put what should be the most typical actions in the 
primary scenario, then come up with some alternatives for the 
secondary scenarios.

Primary:
 authentication of user, enter name of film, choose one cassette, 
finalize rental, pay from credit account, user takes cassette.

Secondaries:

a) authentication fails.

b) authentication of user, enter code for film, finalize rental, pay by
cash, user takes cassette.

c) authentication of user, enter code for film, film not in stock, user
exits.

 These scenarios will show the actions of the system in a couple of 
common situations, and also show some exceptional situations where 
some errors or faults occur.

 Let me know if you have any concerns with these scenarios or if you 
have any suggestions for better ones.  Otherwise, I think we can each go
ahead with our sections.  Until I hear otherwise, I'll assume that Pat is
doing parts 1 & 3, Tu has 2 & 4, and I am doing 5 & 6.

cheers,

Mark.

Hi,

	Re the core use case for deliverable #2, it seems pretty clear that it 
has to be Renting a cassette, so we need the primary scenario and 3 
secondary scenarios for this case.  I have come up with some 
suggestions below for what I think are some typical and not too involved 
scenarios.  I have put what should be the most typical actions in the 
primary scenario, then come up with some alternatives for the 
secondary scenarios.

Primary:
	authentication of user, enter name of film, choose one cassette, 
finalize rental, pay from credit account, user takes cassette.

Secondaries:

a) authentication fails.

b) authentication of user, enter code for film, finalize rental, pay by cash, 
user takes cassette.

c) authentication of user, enter code for film, film not in stock, user exits.

	These scenarios will show the actions of the system in a couple of 
common situations, and also show some exceptional situations where 
some errors or faults occur.

	Let me know if you have any concerns with these scenarios or if you 
have any suggestions for better ones.  Otherwise, I think we can each 
go ahead with our sections.  Until I hear otherwise, I'll assume that Pat is 
doing parts 1 & 3, Tu has 2 & 4, and I am doing 5 & 6.

cheers,

Mark.


> Does #6 of D2 include use case 1 and other use cases?

It must include all of use case 1 and it can include other use cases.
Use Case 1 includes one primary scenario and three secondary scenarios.
You will be graded on whether use case 1 is in.


-- The full boiler plate applies.
-- If there has been any change in the team membership since Deliverable
1, this must be noted in Deliverable 2.  Indicate all team member
allocations and indicate clearly who are the new members of your team.

> 1. Will you be providing a suggested page length per component, as you did for the first deliverable?

Item #1)  4 pages
Item #2  2-3 pages
Item #3   4 pages
Item #4  4 pages
Item #5  5 pages
Item #6  1-2 pages
But the number of pages can be slightly more or less than this.


> 2. Item 5, screen sequences, does this invlove a written description? a diagram of the screen? or both?

This should be a diagram with little screens.  Give the order of the
appearance of the screens in the sequence in which they appear
and indicate what causes the transition in the sequence.

=================================================================================

Dear Students,

Item 2 includes all classes which you are aware of at this time.

Questions 1, 3 and 4 must include enough information to reference one
primary scenario and three secondary scenarios in the core use case in #1.

In Question 4, the high-level class diagram must include at least all
classes and interactions in Use Case 1, but may include more classes.
Finally, item 6 must include the use case (1 primary and 3 secondary) in
Question 1, but may include additional use cases.

I hope this helps.

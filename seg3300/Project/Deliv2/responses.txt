
Hi,

I have quick draft of classes description. I also need
to see quick view of scenario to determine the
associaton correctly.

Could you take quick view of my class, if any thing
missing of major class(es) and let me know.

Mark, for my understand remote system will do all
responses to all the requests from customer, SA, and
managers. Do I have to include all these responses in
the associations of remote system class.

Thank you

Tu

Hi guys,

I just got your message.  That sounds great.  I will handle parts 1 and 3.  I will
take a look at the scenarios tommorrow and send over my 2 cents worth.  Talk to
you then.

For the benefit of all SEG 3300/3700 students, the following formatting
estimates are provided.

Estimated # of Pages
--------------------

The requirements for e-video (project and product) must include:

(1)    *  a description of the overall project requirements
(.5)   *  the project objectives
(.5-1) *  the description and allocation of activities of the project team
(2-3)  *  a list of the main capabilities of the system -- indicate which
          are CORE
(1.5)  *  a list of actors and the brief description of what uniquely
          qualifies an entity to be that type of actor
(2)    *  the high level description of use cases (25 words or less per use
          case)
(1)    *  the system level use case diagram

(1)  The specification of the problem is still not complete.  You are free
     to complete the specification by making realistic assumptions.  Make a
     list of these assumptions with brief justifications in your initial
     requirements document. 

Groups should be formed as soon as possible and the user liaison should
transmit the team title and the members of the team to
bob@site.uottawa.ca.

Please note that the last deliverable will require the inclusion of an
estimate of participation of each of the members of the team.  This is
meant to discourage any "free riders" in the team.

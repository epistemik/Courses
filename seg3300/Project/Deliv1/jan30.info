Dear Marcin Zielinski,

1.  Beware of describing the details of each use-case.  You are only
describing the names and the actors associated with each use-case, and a
brief (25 words or less) description of what is involved in the use-case.
You don't get to the level of primary or secondary scenarios in
Deliverable #1.  Check the previous e-mails, you ARE REQUIRED to provide a
"List of Assumpitons with Justifications".

2.  For your friend's question:

A useful rule is to be precise and concise.  If that results in a serious
ambiguity, you should give enough additional information to clarify what
you mean.  Use common sense and reasonableness in applying those
recommended numbers for number of pages.

I hope this helps.

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Dear Chaitali Sinha,

In deliverable 1, you are to provide a high-level description of what the
system can do.  The use-case NAMES of what the main actors can do with the
system has to be included in the system-level use case diagram, as well as
a brief description of what is involved in each use-case.

I hope this is helpful.

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Page 2 and Page 3 of SEG 3300 Team Project:

allow rental of video cassettes at other places than only in video clubs.
This business has hired you to do the analysis, the Object-oriented design
of the distributor systems.  They would like, as well, to have a prototype
of parts of this system which you can demonstrate by means of
assimilation.  

2.1 The figure below is a schematic diagram of an e-video distributor.
This e-video consists of a display device and a compartment within which
the videos are stored as well as a suitable interface.
2.2 E-video distributor operation.  The e-video distributor must allow
rental of film cassettes as well as rental of video games.  Each cassette
is identified by a unique number which corresponds to a listing in a
catalogue.  Different cassettes may have different rental prices and this
will be reflected in the catalogue.

The customers of the rental chain can rent the films, return the films,
and browse the catalogue on line using the e-video distributor.  Each of
the customers are sent a magnetic access card when they register.  All
customer interactions begin with the CUSTOMER identification which
consists of the insertion of the card and ends with the retrieval of the
card.  Each customer also has a credit account with the rental chain.  

The on-line browsing of the catalogue permits a customer to find the code
of a cassette by searching by the title of the film or game, the name of
the principal actor of the film, or the name of the producer of the film.
The CLIENT/OWNER/OPERATOR may also attach a list of the latest entries
within a certain number of days.

To rent a film, the customer must first insert the card, then specify the
cassettes to be rented by entering their codes.  The CUSTOMER can find the
codes by browsing the catalogue on line before beginning the rental.  Once
the customer has finished entering the cassette codes, the e-video
distributor will determine the amount of the transaction and present it to
the customer.  If the customer has sufficient credit in his account, he
can decide to pay electronically.  In this case, the amount of the rental
is debited directly from the account.  The CUSTOMER may also pay by
inserting money into the e-video distributor machine.  The e-video
distributor returns the desired cassettes by the slot entitled "Cassette
Return".  If the CUSTOMER has paid in cash and there is change to be
returned, he can ask for the change or credit to his account.  At the end
of the rental, the e-video distributor prints a receipt with a list of
cassettes rented, the required dates of return as well as the amount
credited to the account of the customer.  

To return cassettes, the CUSTOMER, after identifying himself, must insert
the cassettes one after one in the recovery return insertion delivery
slot.  After the return of all the cassettes, the e-video distributor
prints a receipt confirming the return and indicates any charges which
will be made for late return.  The fines of the CUSTOMER will be taken out
of his account or added to the amount to be paid for a subsequent rental.
The e-video distributor is maintained by an operator who has the
responsibility of loading the cassettes in the compartment as well as
recovering the money in the containers.  The operator may, as well, ask to
have a report printed on the statistics of cassette rentals.  The operator
is supplied with a magnetic card and a password.  Each of his interactions
must begin by the insertion of the card and validation of his password.

Dear Angela Nash,

The definitions sound good.  Include them in your list of Assumptions with
Justifications.

1.  This appears to be an option for the client; for example, under the
heading "NEW RELEASES", the exact number of days since release for a
video to be considered NEW, is decided by the client.  I suppose the
customer or renter might have a button on the screen to select
"NEW RELEASES", but the client is open to your suggestions here.
A printed report seems more like an off-line system and is NOT 
desirable.  Make and justify your assumptions.  But be careful
not to get into TOO MUCH DETAIL TOO SOON.

2.  "and" should be replaced by "or".  NO double deduction.  The choice
of how this is handled is up to the client.

3.  Number of times each video has been rented over the past month.
[more answers to be given tomorrow]

To continue responding to your questions:

First of all, the words client and customer are not used precisely in
the description of the requirements.  In particular, the description of
renting a film and returning cassettes use "client" and "customer"
interchangeably.  According to your definition, all references in these
sections should be only to "customer".

3. (cont.)  The client needs to know which videos are in high demand,
and which have fallen out of use so that he/she can update the inventory 
accordingly.

4. The customer must have some way of paying for his/her rentals.  One
way is to always pay cash.  Another way is to deposit money into the
credit account.  You should allow both ways.

5. A GUI (graphical user interface with buttons, etc.) would be nice,
but a text-based interface is adequate.

6. For describing team activities in deliverable 1, 

i) the sequence of phases (major activities) should be given with the
milestones that are implied by the given calendar.
ii) a set of major roles and responsibilities as you see it so far
iii) a preliminary assignment of individuals to these roles and
responsibilities.

It is understood that you may wish to revise these as the term
progresses (but keep me informed of any changes).

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Students,

I prefer your amalgamated objective.

I recommend you state the Product Objective first, then the Project
Objectives, first the project objectives which support the quality of
the product, and the efficiency of the project phases (reliability,
functionality; timeliness, meeting the schedule, etc.), then lastly,
your objectives as a student.

Issue 2:
The requirements for e-video (project and product) must include:  (.5) * 
the project objectives.

Question:
Is the project objectives supposed to be geared towards its place in
SEG3300 "Learn how to work as a group at U of O/etc. and to learn how to 
prototype a product"?

OR

should it be geared towards the objective of the product such as "to
boldly make a machine where no video store has gone before, blah, blah,
blah".

OR

should I incorporate the two paths into the one objective:  
- to learn/create a prototype and the docs for SEG3300
- build the best darn e Video machine out there.

Dear student,

This souonds like a good idea for many reasons.  YOu may add this to a
"List of Assumptions with Justifications" and provide your justifications.
You will have to explain what a "cart" is, and what it means to "add to a
cart".

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Dear Fatima and students,

1.  State your assumption regarding this, and justify it in your "List of
Assumptions with Justifications".  Would a real business assume the
customer will always pay his/her fine?  What is reasonable for a real
business to do?  Unless you can justify otherwise, you should try to
handle such issues in a reasonable, realistic way.  Your suggestion of a
threshold limit beyond which a customer will not be allowed to rent seems
reasonable, for example.

2.  You will not have to code for this project, but you can if you want
to.  The detailed design model will be detailed enough that you (and a
reader) will have a good idea of how the system will be implemented
(possiby by someone else in a later course!).

3.  Note to all students in SEG 3300:

   YOu should consider all my responsed involving clarifying requirements
this week as subject to your team risk analysis (at least a simplified
form - namely - "can we include this requirement in deliverable number 1?,
why or why not?, and if not, include it in your list of assumptions with
justifications).

   You should also have a cut-off date for incorporating customer
requirements and wishes for each deliverable.  Wednesday, January 31 may
be a good cut-off date for Deliverable #1, for example.

   If you don't set up a cut-off date for each deliverable (but, be
reasonable), the customer may continue to suggest new or modified
requirements right up to the Due Date!

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

Dear T. Nguyen and Students:

I prefer well organized point form, under a heading "List of Assumptions
with Justifications".

Sincerely,
Prof. Probert

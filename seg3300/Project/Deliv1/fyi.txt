Dear Students,

Although it is reasonable for us to expect you in your 3rd or 4th year of
University studies to know the boiler plate (format) requirements for
assignments and project deliverables, it may be helpful for me to review
them before your hand-ins for Deliverable #1.  

The important elements of a boiler plate are:

i)  Cover Page with:
    - for projects:  your team name and logo, the product name and
      logo or marketing slogan
    - for ALL hand-ins:  the date, course code, section (if appropriate),
      professor's name, your name, student number, e-mail (optional
      now), assignment or deliverable number and date due.

ii)  For a project deliverable:
   
     a)  Executive Summary (1/2 page or less)
         - what the purpose of this deliverable is
         - the intended reader
         - summary of its contents (one or two sentences)
         - what are the key points to be noticed by the reader

     b)  Table of Contents (point form)
         - titles of all headings and all sub-headings, numbered
           legally (i.e., 1, 1.1, 1.1.1, 1.2, etc.) with 
           corresponding page numbers

     c)  Table of Figures
         - labels and titles of all Figures with page numbers

     d)  Table of Tables
         - label and title of all tables with page numbers
         (use the same boiler plate as in the notes for Use Cases and
         Scenarios)

     e)  Glossary of Abbreviations
         - e.g., SET     Secure Electronic Transactions protocols

     f)  References
         - articles, books, previous reports helpful to the reader
         - international or national standards

     g)  Appendices
         - algorithms, prototype code, test cases

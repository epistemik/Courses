standards.</i><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>Handing in Assignments</i></b></font><p>

All assignments for students in CSI 2131<b>A</b> are to be handed in to the 
locked box for CSI 2131<b>A</b> on the third floor of MacDonald Hall, to the 
left of the old Computer Science window.<p>

All assignments for students in CSI 2131<b>B</b> are to be handed in to the 
locked box for CSI 2131<b>B</b> on the third floor of MacDonald Hall, to the 
left of the old Computer Science window.<p>

Assignments must be in a large envelope containing the following items:
<ul><li>a 3.5-inch DOS/Windows diskette with only source files and
MS-DOS executable files for the current assignment. The names of the 
files will be specified in each assignment. Your file names must be 
exactly as specified in the assignment. You will absolutely lose marks 
for wrong file names, missing files or extra files.
<li>a paper printout of your source files
<li>stapled sheets of paper for handwritten (or typed) answers</ul><p>

The outside of the envelope, the diskette and every single sheet of paper
should be labelled clearly with the following information:
<ul><li>your student name and your student number
<li>the course code (CSI 2131)
<li>the section (A or B)
<li>the instructor's name (Ken Barker)
<li>the tutorial group (<i>to be determined</i>)
<li>the TA's name</ul>
<p>

Assignments that do not conform to these instructions will be assumed
to be for the course ELG 4572 and marked accordingly.<p>

<hr>
<font size=+1><b><i>Programming Style</i></b></font><p>

You must program in style. Your TA will show you how in a very early
tutorial. TAs have been given the power to deduct many, many marks for
a poorly written program, <i>even if the program "works" perfectly</i>.<p>

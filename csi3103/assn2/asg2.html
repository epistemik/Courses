1) NetSight Analyst is a tool for observing what is happening on an
Ethernet. It uses a special card attached to the PC's bus that monitors
the Ethernet to which it is attached in the so-called "promiscuous"
mode. When operating in this mode, it monitors <em>all</em> packets on
the Ethernet that satisfy certain user-specified criteria and will
display their contents on the screen of the PC in a number of different
ways

<P>

It is invoked by using the special PC in the Cube, presently the one in
the corner, manufactured by Digital. Just turn the PC on by opening the
small door at the top of the tower and pushing the button. During the
boot sequence you will be asked to enter a password. After the password
has been entered, follow the instructions on the screen to start
NetSight Analyst.

<P>

a) From the window choose the <em>Capture Packets</em> option. The
screen will fill with packet information. If you wish you can use
the <em>Filter Packets</em> function to specify which packets you
wish to capture. The default is <em>all packets</em>.

<P>

b) After a few seconds press ESC to stop the capture. Select the View
Captured Packets option. You can scroll through the captured packets
with the "up arrow" and  "down arrow" keys. Each packet is shown in an
abbreviated form in columns labeled "Frame", "Time", "Dest Address",
"Src Address", and "Description"

<P>

c) Choose a packet with the IPX designation in the "Description"
column. Press ENTER to inspect it in detail. The Hex values in the
packet as well as an interpretation are shown on the screen. You can
see the entire interpretation by scrolling.

<P>

d) Identify all the fields you can within the packet. On a sheet of
paper write down the contents of the packet and the interpretation of
the contents of its fields. Who manufactured the source and destination
NICs?

<P>

e) Repeat sections (3) and (4) after choosing an IP type packet.

<P>

f) Repeat sections (3) and (4) after choosing an ARP type packet.

<P>

g) When finished, return to DOS by pressing ESC and shut down
the machine.

<P>

A help screen can be called by typing &#60;F1&#62;.

<P>

2) Suppose that an error detecting scheme using the generating
polynomial, <EM> P(x) = x <sup> 4 </sup> + x <sup> 3 </sup> + 1 </EM> is to be used in
a data channel. 
<BR>
(a) If the message, <EM>M(x)</EM>, is <B> 00011111000 </B>,
calculate the value of the transmitted message, <EM>T(x)</EM>.
<BR>
(b) Assume that the 7th bit transmitted in <EM>T(x)</EM> is in error by
the time it gets to the receiver. Show in detail how the detection
algorithm, executed at the receiver, can detect the error.

<P>

3) Consider an Idle RQ channel (stop-and-wait), transmitted via a low
orbit satellite, with the following parameters:
<UL>
<LI> propagation time (end to end) = 0.1 s.
<LI> channel capacity = 10 <sup>7 </sup> bps
<LI> bit error rate = 5 * 10 <sup> - 6 </sup>
</UL>
If you must use this channel for data transmission, you would
want to set the frame width (in bits) such that the channel
utilization, <EM>U</EM>, is a maximum.
<BR>
(a) Plot a graph of the channel utilization, <EM>U</EM>, vs. the frame
length, <EM>L</EM>. Consider only the range <EM>(1000 <= L
 <= 1000000)</EM> and use the semi-log graph paper in the
notes to plot your graph.
<BR>
(b) What is the maximum value of <EM>U</EM> possible for this channel?
<BR>
(c) What value of the frame length, <EM>L</EM>, gives this value?
<BR>
(d) What is the value of the parameter, <EM>a</EM>, when <EM>U</EM> is a
maximum?
<BR>
(e) If, for some reason beyond your control, you can only use a frame
width of 64000 bits, what is the value of <EM>U</EM>?

<P>

4) Consider the following bit sequence <EM> as it appears on the
wire</EM> used in a bit oriented protocol such as HDLC. The frame
delimiters are included.
<BR>
<B>011111101011101011110101010011111011111010100110101000111111001...
</B>
<BR>
If this sequence is valid, what is the actual transmitted
message?

<P>

<P>

6) Stallings P. 224 Q. 7.4.

<P>

7) Stallings P. 224 Q. 7.21.

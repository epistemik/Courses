Assignment 2 - October 25, 2000 
1) NetSight Analyst is a tool for observing what is happening on an Ethernet. It 
uses a special card attached to the PC's bus that monitors the Ethernet to which 
it is attached in the so-called "promiscuous" mode. When operating in this mode, 
it monitors all packets on the Ethernet that satisfy certain user-specified 
criteria and will display their contents on the screen of the PC in a number of 
different ways 
It is invoked by using the special PC in the Cube, presently the one in the 
corner, manufactured by Digital. Just turn the PC on by opening the small door 
at the top of the tower and pushing the button. During the boot sequence you 
will be asked to enter a password. After the password has been entered, follow 
the instructions on the screen to start NetSight Analyst. 
a) From the window choose the Capture Packets option. The screen will fill with 
packet information. If you wish you can use the Filter Packets function to 
specify which packets you wish to capture. The default is all packets. 
b) After a few seconds press ESC to stop the capture. Select the View Captured 
Packets option. You can scroll through the captured packets with the "up arrow" 
and "down arrow" keys. Each packet is shown in an abbreviated form in columns 
labeled "Frame", "Time", "Dest Address", "Src Address", and "Description" 
c) Choose a packet with the IPX designation in the "Description" column. Press 
ENTER to inspect it in detail. The Hex values in the packet as well as an 
interpretation are shown on the screen. You can see the entire interpretation by 
scrolling. 
d) Identify all the fields you can within the packet. On a sheet of paper write 
down the contents of the packet and the interpretation of the contents of its 
fields. Who manufactured the source and destination NICs? 
e) Repeat sections (3) and (4) after choosing an IP type packet. 
f) Repeat sections (3) and (4) after choosing an ARP type packet. 
g) When finished, return to DOS by pressing ESC and shut down the machine. 
A help screen can be called by typing <F1>. 
2) Suppose that an error detecting scheme using the generating polynomial, P(x) 
= x 4 + x 3 + 1 is to be used in a data channel. 
(a) If the message, M(x), is 00011111000 , calculate the value of the 
transmitted message, T(x). 
(b) Assume that the 7th bit transmitted in T(x) is in error by the time it gets 
to the receiver. Show in detail how the detection algorithm, executed at the 
receiver, can detect the error. 
3) Consider an Idle RQ channel (stop-and-wait), transmitted via a low orbit 
satellite, with the following parameters: 
  propagation time (end to end) = 0.1 s. 
  channel capacity = 10 7 bps 
  bit error rate = 5 * 10 - 6 
If you must use this channel for data transmission, you would want to set the 
frame width (in bits) such that the channel utilization, U, is a maximum. 
(a) Plot a graph of the channel utilization, U, vs. the frame length, L. 
Consider only the range (1000 <= L <= 1000000) and use the semi-log graph paper 
in the notes to plot your graph. 
(b) What is the maximum value of U possible for this channel? 
(c) What value of the frame length, L, gives this value? 
(d) What is the value of the parameter, a, when U is a maximum? 
(e) If, for some reason beyond your control, you can only use a frame width of 
64000 bits, what is the value of U? 
4) Consider the following bit sequence as it appears on the wire used in a bit 
oriented protocol such as HDLC. The frame delimiters are included. 
011111101011101011110101010011111011111010100110101000111111001... 
If this sequence is valid, what is the actual transmitted message? 
5) Stallings P. 224 Q. 7.2. 
6) Stallings P. 224 Q. 7.4. 
7) Stallings P. 224 Q. 7.21. 
This assignment is due at 23:00 on Nov. 6, 2000.
An assignment submitted late will still be marked but will be subject to a 
penalty of 0.95 n where n is the number of days late.

Hello,

For any connected graph

1) Calculate the length (hop number) of the shortest path between all
pairs of nodes.

2) The largest of these numbers is the "diameter" of the graph.

The diameter of the graph on page 321 of Stallings is 3.

The actual diameter of the graph on page 321 is 2 (not 3), assuming that
all segments are bidirectional. For some reason, the hop counter of the
flooding example is set to 3 rather than to the diameter of the graph.
